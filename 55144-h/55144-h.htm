<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. HENRY DELPECH (Assistant Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Mr. President, Your Honors, I had the honor yesterday
of beginning to explain before the Tribunal the methods of
economic spoliation of Belgium by the Germans in the course of
their occupation of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming back to what was said in the course of the general
considerations on economic pillage and on the behavior of the
Germans in Norway and Denmark and in Holland, I have been
able to show that in all places the determination to economic
domination of National Socialism had manifested itself. The methods
were the same everywhere, at least in their broad outlines. Therefore
in immediate response to the wish expressed yesterday by the
Tribunal and to fulfill the mission entrusted to the French Prosecution
by the Belgian Government to plead its case before your
high jurisdiction, I shall confine myself to the main outlines of
the development, and I shall take the liberty of referring to the
details of the German seizure of Belgian production, to the text of
the report submitted to the Tribunal, and to the numerous documents
which are quoted in our document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have had the honor of calling your attention to the existence
of the black market in Belgium, its organization by the occupation
troops, and their final decision to suppress this black market. One
may, with respect to this, conclude, as has already been indicated
in the course of the general observations, that in spite of their
claims it was not in order to avoid inflation in Belgium that the
German authorities led a campaign against the black market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day the Germans decided to suppress the black market,
they loudly proclaimed their anxiety to spare the Belgian
economy and the Belgian population the very serious consequences
of the threatening inflation. In reality, the German authorities
intervened against the black market in order to prevent its ever-growing
extension from reaching the point where it would absorb
all the available merchandise and completely strangle the official
market. In a word, the survival of the official market with its
lower prices was finally much more profitable for the army of
occupation.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come, gentlemen, to Page 46 of my presentation, to the
third Chapter—purchases which were regular in appearance; which
had only one aim, namely the subjugation of Belgian productive
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrying out their program of domination of the countries of
Western Europe as it had been established since before 1939, the
Germans, from the moment they entered Belgium in May 1940,
took all the measures which seemed to them appropriate to assure
the subjugation of Belgian production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sector of Belgian economy was to be spared. If the pillage
seems more noticeable in the economic sphere, that is only because
of the very marked industrial character of Belgian economy.
Agriculture and transport were not to escape the German hold,
and I propose to discuss first the levies in kind in industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belgian industry was the first to be attacked. Thus, the military
commander in Belgium, in agreement with the various offices of
the Reich for raw materials and with the Office of the Four Year
Plan and the Ministry of Economics, drew up a program the purpose
of which was to convert almost the whole of Belgian production
to the bellicose ends of the Reich. Already on the 13th
of September 1940 he was able to make known to the higher
authorities a series of plans for iron, coal, textiles, and copper.
I submit Exhibit Number RF-162 (Document Number ECH-2) in
support of this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also a report by Lieutenant Colonel, Dr. Hedler, entitled “Change
in Economic Direction,” states that from 14 September 1940 the
Army Ordnance Branch sent to its subordinate formations the
following instructions, to be found in the document book under
Exhibit Number RF-163 (Document Number ECH-84). I read the
last paragraph of Page 41 of the German text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I attach the greatest importance to the proposition that the
factories in the occupied western territories, Holland, Belgium,
and France, be utilized as much as possible to ease
the strain on the German armament production and to
increase the war potential. Enterprises located in Denmark
are also to be employed to an increasing extent for subcontracts.
In doing so the operational directives of the regulation
of the Reich Marshal as well as the regulations concerning
the economy of raw materials in the occupied territories are
to be strictly observed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>All these arrangements quickly enabled the Germans to control
and to direct Belgium’s whole production and distribution for the
German war effort.
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The decree of 27 May 1940, VOBEL Number 2, submitted as
Document Number RF-164, established commodity control offices
whose task was—and I quote from the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to issue, in compliance with Army Group directives,
general regulations or individual orders to enterprises which
are producing, dealing with, or using controlled commodities,
in order to regulate production and ensure just distribution
and rational utilization while keeping to the place of work,
as far as possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Article 4 of the same text indicated in detail the powers of
these commodity control offices, and in particular they were given
the right:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To force enterprises to sell their products to specified
purchasers; to forbid or require the utilization of certain raw
materials; to subject to their approval every sale or purchase
of commodities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To conceal more effectively their real objective, the Germans
gave these commodity control offices independence and the status
of a corporation. Thus, there were set up 11 commodity control
offices which embraced the whole economy except coal, the
direction of which was left under the Belgian Office of Coal.
Exhibit Number RF-165 (Document Number ECH-3), gives proof
of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The execution of the regulations was ensured by a series of
texts promulgated by the Belgian authorities in Brussels. They
issued in particular a decree dated 3 September 1940, by virtue
of which Belgian organizations took over again the offices which the
Germans gave up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These offices were to experience various vicissitudes. Although
originating from the Belgian Ministry of Economics, they were
closely controlled by the German military command. In this way,
the seizure of Belgian production was completed by the appointment
of “Commissioners of Enterprises,” under the ordinance of 29 April
1941, submitted as Document Number RF-166. Article 2 of this text
defines the powers of the commissioners:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The duty of the Commissioner is to set or keep in motion
the enterprise under his charge, to ensure the systematic
fulfillment of orders, and to take all measures which increase
the output.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The decline of the commodity control offices began with an
ordinance dated 6 August 1942, establishing the principle providing
for the prohibition of manufacturing certain products or for ordering
the use of certain raw materials. This ordinance is to be found in
the document book under Document Number RF-167. Supervision
of the commodity control offices was soon organized by the
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
appointment to each of them of a German Commissioner, selected
by the competent Reichsstelle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the last months of 1943 on, the “Rüstungsobmann” Office
of the Armament and War Production Ministry (Speer), acquired
the habit of passing its orders direct, without having recourse to
the channel of the commodity control offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even before this date measures had been taken to prevent any
initiative that was not in accord with the German war aims. Further
and even before the above ordinance of 6 August 1942, the ordinance
of 30 March 1942 should be mentioned, which made the establishment
or extension of commercial enterprises subject to previous
authorization by the military commissioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the report of the military administration in Belgium that has
already been cited, the chief of the administrative staff, Reeder,
specifies in Exhibit Number RF-169 (Document Number ECH-335)
that for the period of January to March 1943 alone, out of 2,000
iron works, 400 were closed down for working irrationally or being
useless to the war aims. The closing of these factories seems to
have been caused less by the concern for a rational production than
by the cunning desire to obtain cheaply valuable tools and machines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, it is appropriate to point to the establishment
of a Machine Pool Office. The above quoted report of the military
administration in Belgium, in the 11th section, Pages 56 and following,
is particularly significant in this respect. Here is an extract
from the German text, the last lines of the last paragraph of
Page 56, in the French translation, the last lines .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT (Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence): That
passage you read about the Defendant Raeder, was that from
Document 169 or 170?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: Mr. President, I spoke yesterday of the chief of
the administration section, Reeder. He was section chief in Brussels.
He has no connection with the defendant here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see, very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: Exhibit Number RF-171 (Document Number
ECH-10), second paragraph of the French text. The paragraph
concerns the Machine Pool transactions:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Proof may be seen by a brief glance at the pool operations
dealt with and actually carried out. Altogether 567 demands
have been dealt with, to a total value of 4.6 million Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Reeder then gave a number of figures. I shall pass over these and
I come to the end of the first paragraph, Page 57 in the German text:
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The legal basis for the requisition of these machines was
the Hague Convention of 1907, Articles 52 and 53. The formulation
of the Hague Convention which provides for requisitions
only for the benefit and the needs of the occupying
power, applied to the circumstances of the year 1907, that is,
to a time when war actions were confined within narrowly
restricted areas and practically the military front alone was
involved in war operations. In view of such space restrictions
for war, it was evident that the provisions of the Hague
Convention, stipulating that requisitions be made solely for
the needs of the occupying power, were sufficient for the
conduct of operations. Modern war, however, which by its
expansion to total war is no longer bound by space but has
developed into a general struggle of peoples and economies,
requires that while the regulations of the Hague Convention
should be maintained, there should be a sensible interpretation
of its principles adapted to the demands of modern warfare.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to the end of this quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whenever, in requisitioning, reference was made to the
ordinance of the military commander of 6 August 1942, this
was done in order to give the Belgian population the necessary
interpretation of the meaning of the principle of the requisition
regulations of the Hague Convention.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such an interpretation may leave jurists wondering, who have
not been trained in the school of National Socialism. It cannot in
any case justify the pillage of industry and the subjugation of
Belgian production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These few considerations show how subtle and varied were the
methods employed by the Germans to attain their aims in the
economic sphere. In the same way as the preceding statements on
clearing operations and the utilization of occupation costs, they
make it possible to specify the methods employed for exacting heavy
levies from the Belgian economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereas in certain spheres, as in agriculture and transport, it
has been possible to assess the extent of economic pillage with a
certain exactitude, there are, however, numerous industrial sectors
where assessments cannot yet be made. It is true that a considerable
part of the industrial losses correspond to the clearing operations,
particularly through requisition of stocks. It will therefore be
necessary to confine ourselves to the directives of the policy
practiced by the Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may examine briefly the way in which economic spoliation
took place in three sectors: industry, agriculture, and transport.
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>First the industrial sector: The clearing statistics, in the first
place, give particulars of the total burdens imposed upon the various
industrial branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the military administration in Belgium, to which
I shall refer constantly, gives the following details, briefly summarized:</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the very beginning of the occupation the Germans
demanded an inventory of supplies on which they were to impose
considerable levies, notably textiles and non-ferrous metals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall confine myself to some brief remarks on textiles and non-ferrous
metals. The example of the textiles industry is particularly
revealing: On the eve of the invasion, the Belgian textile industry,
with its 165,000 workers, was the second largest industry in Belgium
after the metal industry. Under the pretext of avoiding the exhaustion
of the very important supplies then still available, an
ordinance of 27 July 1940 prohibited the textile industry to work
at more than 30 percent of its 1938 capacity. For the period from
May to December 1940 alone requisitions were not less than 1,000
million Belgian francs. They particularly affected nearly half of
the wool stock available in the country on May 10, 1940, and nearly
one-third of the stock of raw cotton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, the forced closing down of factories constituted
for the Germans an excellent excuse for taking away, on
the pretext of hiring, unused equipment, unless it was requisitioned
at a cheap price. The ordinance of 7 September 1942, which is to be
found in the document book under Document Number RF-174, laid
down the manner in which factories were to be closed in execution
of the right accorded to the occupation authorities; and it also gave
the right to dissolve certain business and industrial groups and to
order their liquidation. Consolidation of enterprises was the pretext
given. In the month of January 1944, 65 percent of the textile
factories had been stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not go into the details of these operations and I shall
pass on to Page 58. The report of the German military administration
quoted above gives particularly significant figures as to production.
Of a total output of the wool industry of 72,000 tons for the entire
period May 1940 to the end of June 1944, representing a value of
about 397 million Reichsmark, the distribution of the deliveries
between the German and Belgian markets is the following: The
German market, 64,700 tons, 314 million Reichsmark; the Belgian
market, 7,700 tons, 83 million Reichsmark. The whole spoliation of
the textile industry is contained in these figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belgian consumption obviously had to suffer a great deal from
the German policy of direction of the textile market. The same
report of the military administration furnishes details, stating that
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
in 1938 the needs in textile products amounted in Belgium to a
monthly average of twelve kilos. The respective figures for the
occupation years are the following: 1940 to 1941—2.1 kilos per head,
1941 to 1942—1.4, 1942 to 1943—1.4, 1943 to 1944—0.7. The diminution
of Belgian consumption under the Germans is contained in
these two figures; twelve kilos per head in 1938; 0.7 kilo at the
end of the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side, the Belgian Government gives the following
details on the pillage of this produce. Compulsory deliveries to
Germany during the occupation amounted to:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cotton yarn, about 40 percent of the production; linen, 75 percent;
rayon, 15 percent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, out of the textile stocks remaining in Belgium a great
percentage was still taken away by the Germans through purchases
on the Belgian markets, purchases of finished or manufactured
products. The equivalent of these forced deliveries can generally
be found in the clearing statistics, unless it is placed under
misrepresented occupation costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have finished with textiles. As to the non-ferrous metal
industry, Belgium was in 1939 the largest producer in Europe of
non-ferrous metals, of copper, lead, zinc, and tin. The statistics
included in the report of the military command, which are to be
found in Exhibit Number RF-173 (Document Number ECH-11), will
furnish the evidence for the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 18th of February 1941, in connection with the Four Year
Plan, the Reich Office for Metals and the Supreme Command of
the Army worked out a “metal” plan which provided for Belgian
consumption; the carrying out of German orders; exports to the
Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These various measures did not satisfy the occupying authorities
so they ran a certain number of salvage campaigns which were
called “special actions” (Sonderaktionen) in accordance with the
method they applied in all the countries of Western Europe. I shall
not go into the details of these actions which are described on Page 63
and following of the report; the salvage campaigns for bells, for
printing lead, for lead and copper—from information given by the
Belgian Government, Document Number RF-146, Page 65 of the
report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other fields, but without admitting it, the Germans pursued
a policy intended to eliminate or to restrict Belgian competition, so
that in case of a German victory the economic branches concerned
would have had to restrict themselves to the Belgian market, which
would then have remained wide open to German business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These attempts at immediate or future suppression of competition
were clearly evident in the case of foundries, glass works, textile
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
industries, construction works, car assembling, construction of
material for narrow-gauge railroads, the leather industry, and
especially shoe-manufacturing, for which reconstruction of destroyed
factories was systematically prohibited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in addition, in the textile industry as well as in numerous
sectors, especially in the iron-smelting industry, the weakening of
the economy cannot be measured only by the scale of the compulsory
deliveries but in relation to the policy practiced by the
occupying power. Belgian industry, especially coal and iron, suffered
considerable losses as a result of directives imposed to finance the
war needs at a cheaper rate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass over the question of prices of coal. The control of
the coal industry was assured by the appointment of a plenipotentiary
for coal and by centralization of all sales in the hands of a single
organism, the “single seller,” under Belgian direction but with a
German commissioner. I am referring to the Belgian coal office,
one seller to a single purchaser, “Rheinisch Westfälisches Kohlensyndikat,”
which ordered deliveries to be made to the Reich, to
Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the same German report, Page 67, in spite of the
rise in the price of coal agreed to on 20 August 1940, 1 January
1941, and 1 January 1943, the coal industry showed considerable
losses in the course of the occupation years. In February 1943, the
coal office having agreed to an increase of the sales price, the price
per ton for the Belgian coal was higher than on the German home
market. The German commissioner for the mining industry forced
the Belgian industry to pay the difference in rate when exporting
to the Reich by means of premiums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the figures indicated in Exhibits Numbers RF-176 (Document
Number ECH-35) and 178 (Document Numbers ECH-26 and 27),
the Tribunal may gather information as to the financial losses
caused by exploitation. The report of the military administration
gives in its eleventh section details regarding the iron-smelting
industry: It suffered as greatly as had the coal industry during the
occupation. In the Thomas smelting works in particular, the losses
resulted from the increase in the cost price and from price
fluctuations in respect to certain elements pertaining to the manufacture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this one sector, according to the memorandum of the Belgian
Government, the respective losses may be assessed at 3,000 million
Belgian francs. Still, according to the same report, out of a total
production of 1,400,000 tons, 1,300,000 tons of various products were
exported to Germany not including the metal delivered to Belgian
factories working exclusively for Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>According to information furnished by the Belgian Government,
the Germans removed in bulk and transported to Germany material
of very great value. The total industrial spoliation is estimated by
the Belgian Government at a sum of 2,000 million Belgian francs,
at the 1940 rate, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These removals constitute a real material loss; and from the
fragmentary indications given to the Tribunal, this sum of 2,000
million Belgian francs is the figure which I ask the Tribunal to note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the information available at present it is not easy to
estimate the extent of the levies made on industry; it is even more
difficult to evaluate it in the agricultural sphere, which I shall
briefly present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from the admissible needs of the occupation troops, the
German authorities made an effort to obtain a supplement to the
food levies in Belgium for the purpose of increasing the food of the
Reich and other territories occupied by its troops. After having
employed direct methods of levying, the Germans used the services
of unscrupulous agents whose job it was to purchase at any price
on the illicit markets; and the black market in this field assumed
such proportions that the occupying authorities were frequently
alarmed and in 1943 had to suppress it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from the damage to livestock and to the woods and
forests, which play an important part in Belgium, the damage
resulting from abnormal cutting in the forests brought about an
excess in deforestation reaching a figure of 2 million tons; the
damage to capital caused by this premature cutting can be estimated
at about 200 million Belgian francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military operations proper caused damage to an extent of
100 million Belgian francs; and according to the memorandum of
the Belgian Government, the total damage caused to forestry reaches
a figure of 460 million Belgian francs. Taking into account the
damage caused by abnormal cutting in the forests and by the
establishment of airfields, the Belgian Government estimates at
approximately 1,000 million Belgian francs the losses suffered by
its agriculture during the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be noted, without going further into this subject, that
these are net losses in capital, constituting a veritable exhaustion
of substance and a consequent reduction and real consumption of
the nation’s resources. With this I have concluded my presentation
concerning agriculture, and I pass on to transport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conduct of war led the Germans to utilize to the utmost the
railroad network and the canal and river system of Belgium. The
result was that the railroads and river fleet are included in those
branches of Belgian economy which suffered most from the occupation
and the hostilities which took place on Belgian soil. German
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
traffic was simultaneously a traffic of personnel as demanded by
military operations and a traffic of merchandise, coal, minerals,
pit-props, foodstuffs, not to speak of the considerable quantities of
construction material required for the fortification of the coast of the
North Sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Railroads: The report of the Belgian Government shows that
the damages suffered by the railroads consisted of losses in capital
as well as of losses in revenue. Losses in capital resulted first and
principally from requisitions and removals, to which the Germans
proceeded in a wholesale fashion from the moment of their entry
into Belgium. Thus in particular they immediately drained the
stock of locomotives under the pretext of recovering German
locomotives surrendered to Belgium after the war of 1914-1918 as
a means of reparation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to seizures of locomotives, the Belgian National Railroad
Company was subjected to numerous requisitions of material,
sometimes under the form of rental; these requisitions are estimated
at 4,500 million francs at the 1940 value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Against the losses in capital, losses in revenue (Page 77) resulted
principally from the free transportation service required by the
Wehrmacht, also from the price policy pursued by the occupying
power. These levies and these exceptional costs could be borne by
the organizations concerned only by making large drains on the
treasury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding automobiles, I shall say hardly anything (Page 79).
The losses amount to about 3,000 million Belgian francs, out of
which individuals received as compensation for requisition approximately
1,000 million (at the 1938 value).</p>

<p class='pindent'>We come now to river transport: The carrying out of the plan
for the economic spoliation of Belgium presented the occupying
power with serious transportation problems, to which I have already
called attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this sphere the German military administration imposed upon
Belgian river shipping very heavy burdens. According to the report
of the Belgian Government, the losses suffered by the Belgian river
fleet took three forms: Requisitions and removals by the Germans;
partial or total damage through military operations; excessive
deterioration of material. These three forms of damage amount to
500 million francs, of which only 100 million are represented in
clearing. Damage to waterways (Page 81), rivers, streams, and canals,
can be evaluated at between 1,500 million to 2,000 million francs,
at the 1940 value, especially with respect to requisitions and
removals of public or private harbor installations.
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Fishing boats were requisitioned for marking the river Scheldt
and then disappeared without leaving any trace. Others suffered
damage through requisitions or hire for military maneuvers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before closing this chapter concerned with levies in kind, the
question of removal of industrial material may be briefly mentioned
(Page 82).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has already been pointed out that the policy of production
and reorganization as pursued by the military administration had
as a result the closing of numerous enterprises, thus enabling the
Germans to seize a great number of machines under the pretext
that they were out of use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are no branches of industry which were not despoiled in
this way. The metal industry seems now to be one of those that
suffered most. Though we do not wish to try the patience of the
Tribunal, it seems particularly pertinent to draw its attention briefly
to the actual technique used in the organization of the levies,
details which were decided upon even before the entry of German
troops into the territories of Western Europe, organization putting
into play military formations, organization emanating from the
economy bureau of the General Staff of the Army and hence from
the Defendant Keitel as Chief of the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The existence of these military detachments, veritable pillaging
detachments, is proved by various German documents. Under the
name of economic detachments, “Wirtschaftstrupps,” or special commandos,
these pillaging crews carried out nefarious and illegal
activities in all the countries of Western Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secret instructions for the “economic detachment J,” stationed
at Antwerp, are found in the file under Document Number RF-183.
They constitute a very important, irrefutable document on the
German intention to pillage and an additional proof of the contempt
of the National Socialist leaders for the rules of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These instructions date from the last days of May 1940. I should
like to read a few excerpts of these instructions to the Tribunal
(Document Number RF-183, Page 1).</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The economic detachments are formed by the office for
economic armament of the High Command of the Wehrmacht.
They are placed at the disposal of the High Command of the
Army for employment in the countries to be occupied.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I shall skip to the bottom of Page 1 of the German document.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is their task to gain information quickly and completely
in their districts of the scarce and rationed goods (raw materials,
semi-finished products, mineral oil, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>) and
machines of most vital importance for the purposes of national
defense and to make a correct return of these stocks.
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk102'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the case of machines, the requisition will be effected by
means of a label, in the case of scarce and rationed goods,
both by labelling and by guarding.</p>
<hr class='tbk103'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, the economic detachments have the duty of
preparing and, upon order of the Army Group, of carrying
out the removal of scarce and rationed goods, mineral oils,
and the most important machines. These tasks are the exclusive
responsibility of the economic detachments.</p>
<hr class='tbk104'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The economic detachments are to commence their activities
in newly occupied territories as early as the battle situation
permits.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Machines and raw materials having thus been found and
identified, the new organizations went into action to dismantle
and put to use these machines and raw materials in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above quoted document RF-183 gives precise and very
curious information on the formation and the strength of detachment
“J” at Antwerp. The eight officers are all reserve officers,
engineers, wholesale dealers, directors of mines, importers of raw
materials, engineering consultants. Their names and their professions
are mentioned in the document. These men are therefore
all specialists in commerce and industry. The choice of these
technicians cannot be attributed to mere chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the above instructions and more especially the
instructions found under date of 10 May 1940, coming from General
Hannecken (Exhibit Number RF-184), Document Number ECH-33,
once the machines and the stocks have been identified, the offices
set to work, the Roges on one hand, and the compensation bureaus
on the other hand, to whose activities attention has already been
called in connection with the pillage of Holland and of the Belgian
non-ferrous metal industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another document, which is likewise presented as Exhibit
Number RF-184 (Document Number ECH-33), shows that the very
composition of the economic detachments emanates from the High
Command. Quoting from Page 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The economic detachments already mentioned in Section I,
which are composed of experts for the branches of industry
found in the respective areas, shall gain information and
secure stocks of raw materials and special machinery for the
production of ammunition and war equipment which are at
present important.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that quotation set out in your dossier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: The quotation is on Page 84, bis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would this be a convenient time to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: Besides the economic detachments to which I
have just drawn the attention of the Tribunal, detailed to remove
and redistribute machinery either to factories working in the
country on behalf of the occupying power or to factories in Germany,
these operations were directed by the Machine Pool Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such offices were set up in all the occupied territories of
Western Europe during the last months of 1942, upon the order of
the Minister for Armaments and War Production, for example,
the Defendant Speer, and the Office of the Four Year Plan, for
example, the Defendant Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Machine Pool Office for Belgium and Northern France was
set up upon the decision of the Chief of the Military Economic
Section in Brussels under date of 18 February 1943. Its activity
has already been outlined to the Tribunal in connection with the
spoliation of non-ferrous metal industries. Its activity did not stop
there; it is found in all branches of industry. The Exhibit Number
RF-185 (Document ECH-29) can give us figures on its activity.
This activity continued to the very last days of the occupation.
Requisitions of machinery and instruments were not limited to
industry; Documents Numbers ECH-16 and ECH-15 (Exhibits Numbers
RF-193 and 194) show the extent of the requisitioning of
scientific instruments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have finished with the levies on industrial material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall present briefly in the fourth chapter the question of
services, first of all:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The billeting of troops. By an ordinance dated 17 December
1940, Page 88, the Germans imposed the costs of billeting their
troops upon Belgium. Having done this, the occupation authorities
justified themselves by a rather liberal interpretation of Article 52
of the Hague Convention, according to the provisions of which the
occupying power may require levies in kind and in services.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Wetter report (Document Number RF-186) wrongly contends
that the Convention does not specify by whom the settlement should
be made; Article 49 gives the right to make the occupied country
defray the expenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore Belgium had to meet expenses to the amount of
5,900 million francs for billeting costs, equipment, and furniture.
The payments of the Belgian treasury for billeting is estimated in
the report of the Belgian Military Administration at 5,423 million
francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is evident that under the pretext of billeting costs, other
expenses were entered to the detriment of the Belgian economy,
as in other occupied countries—the purchases of furniture which
was to be sent to Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Transport and Communications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To assure transport and communications, the Belgian treasury
had to advance a total of 8,000 million francs. As already pointed
out to the Tribunal, the seizure by the occupation authorities
covered even the river fleet to the extent that the transport plan
restricted the use of rail to the operation troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Article 53 of the Hague Convention, the occupying
army has the right to seize means of transport and communications
provided that it returns them and pays indemnity. That army,
however, does not possess the right to make the occupied country
pay the costs of transport put at the army’s disposal. That is,
however, what Germany did in Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deportation of labor to Germany and forced labor in Belgium
have already been explained to the Tribunal. It therefore seems
unnecessary to stress this point (Page 91). At the most, we should
recall certain consequences unfavorable to the Belgian economy.
The measures concerning the deportation of labor caused an
economic disorganization and weakening without precedent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, the departure of workers and particularly of skilled
workers inadequately replaced by unskilled labor—women, adolescents
and pensioners—brought about a decrease in production at
the same time as an increase in the cost price, which contributed
to complicating the problem of the financial equilibrium of industrial
enterprises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third observation: The requisition of labor was the cause of
political and social discontent owing to the dispersion of families
and the inequalities which appeared in the requisition of workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fourth and last observation: The workers were required for
spheres of work which were not necessarily their own, which
resulted in a loss of their professional skill. Personnel were divided
and unclassed. The closing of artisan workshops brought about
changes more or less felt in certain branches of production. The
losses thus suffered cannot be measured in terms of money, but they
are none the less important to be submitted to your jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have finished with this subject and will turn to a last chapter,
Chapter V, the acquisition of Belgian investments in foreign
industrial enterprises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since 1940 according to their general policy in all occupied
countries of Western Europe, the Germans concerned themselves
with acquiring shares in Belgian financial enterprises abroad. The
official German point of view emerges clearly from a letter dated
29 July 1941, from the Minister of Finance to the Military Commander
in Belgium. I have submitted it under Number 187, in the
document book (Document Number RF-187).
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This conception of the right to acquire shares is certainly very
far from the idea as laid down by the Hague Convention in respect
to the right of requisition. It clearly shows the German leaders’
determination for enrichment at the expense of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the Germans, since May 1940, sought to obtain influence
in Belgian holding companies. Not being able to violate directly
international laws, particularly Article 46 of the Hague Convention,
they strove to influence the members of the executive boards
through persuasion rather than by force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of a conference held on 3 May 1940 at the Reich
Ministry of Economics, dealing with Belgian and Dutch capital
which it would still be possible to acquire, it was decided that the
Military Commander in Belgium should take all necessary measures
to prevent, on the one hand, the destruction, transfer, sale, and
illegal holding of all bonds and stocks of these countries and, on
the other hand, to induce Belgian capitalists to hand over their
foreign securities to the Germans. The minutes of this conference
are found in the document book under Number RF-187 above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prevent the flight of any capital, an ordinance of 17 June 1940
was promulgated, subjecting to authorization the sending abroad
of any securities and any acquisitions or disposal of foreign securities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 2 August 1940 the German leaders and the Defendant
Göring himself took a definite stand on this point. In the course of
the general remarks on economic plundering secret directives issued
in this respect by the Defendant Göring were read to you. It is the
document submitted under Number RF-105 (Page 97).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of the German assurances and in spite of the wish of
the occupying power to preserve the appearance of regularity, the
German desire to absorb certain shares met with serious resistance.
The occupation authorities several times had to resort to compulsion
to conclude sales, in spite of the rights which they had reserved
for themselves in the above cited decree of 27 August 1940. This
was particularly the case with regard to the shares held by the
Belgian Metal Trust in the electrical enterprises of Eastern Silesia
and, still more clearly, the case regarding the shares of the Austrian
Metal Company, which at that time were wanted by the Hermann
Göring Works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Belgian ill-will increased as the German determination to
pillage became more evident. In this report of 1 December 1942,
Exhibit Number RF-191 (Document Number ECR-132), the German
Commissioner with the National Bank very clearly denounces this
resistance on the part of the Belgian market. Almost all acquisitions
which could be realized by the Germans were settled by means of
clearing (Page 98).
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The balance of clearing capital credited to Belgium, to the amount
of 1,000 million Belgian francs on 31 August 1944, represents a
forced loan imposed upon Belgium without any legal or logical
relation to occupation costs, unless it is the Germans’ will to
hegemony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a practice, contrary to the principles of international law
and to the rules of criminal law of civilized nations, falls under
Article 6(b) of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal and
constitutes an act of pillage of public or private property such as is
envisaged in the above-mentioned text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closely allied to the acquisition of shares and always within
the framework of legality, the levies made by the German authorities
on foreign, enemy, and Jewish property, should be pointed out to
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to foreign property seized by the Germans, it must be
mentioned that this measure was applied to French capital in
Belgium in spite of numerous protests by the French Government.
As to Jewish property, for the years 1943 and 1944, the figures are
presented in Document Number ECH-35 (Exhibit Number RF-192).</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this I conclude the presentation of the economic spoliation
of Belgium (Page 100).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The damage caused to Belgian economy in its principal branches
have just been submitted to the Tribunal. The statistical data have
been taken either from German reports or from official reports of
the Belgian Government. The available estimates and figures are
not yet sufficiently exact to fix the costs of war, the occupation and
economic spoliation of Belgium; some losses and damages cannot
be expressed in money. Among them, first of all, we must mention
the privations resulting from the German commandeering of a large
part of food supplies and from the particular situation of billeting
and clothing. This purely material aspect of the question should not
cause us to overlook the consequences of the occupation upon the
public health (Page 103). For lack of statistical data, it is difficult to
show precisely the final state of public health resulting from the
particular circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One fact, however, must be remembered: The considerable increase
in the number of persons who were eligible for special invalid
diets. This number rose from 2,000 a month in 1941 to more than
25,000 a month in 1944. It had, therefore, increased more than tenfold,
in spite of the rationing measures which became more and
more severe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This increase in nutritional aid given to sick persons deserves
the attention of the Tribunal, less for itself and for its statistical
interest, than because it is the indication of the increase of disease
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
in Belgium. This increase is itself the result of the undernourishment
of the population during the four years of occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This deplorable state of affairs, however, had not escaped the
attention of the occupation authorities, as appears from the letter
of the Military Commander in Belgium already quoted which is
found in the document book under Document Number RF-187:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Regarding the food situation in Belgium, neither the minimum
for existence for the civilian population is secured nor the
minimum amount necessary for feeding heavy laborers who
are employed solely in the interest of the German war
economy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not dwell on this. This undernourishment of the Belgian
population has been the inevitable and the most serious result of
the huge levies made by the occupation authorities who willfully
disregarded the elementary requirements of an occupied country
in order to pursue only the war aims of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lowering of the average standard of health and the rise in
the death rate in Belgium from 1940 to 1945 may therefore be
rightly considered the direct result of the spoliations committed
by the Germans in Belgium in transgression of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have concluded the presentation on Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to make a few brief remarks on the economic
pillaging of Luxembourg (Page 106).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supplementing the presentation on Belgium it is fitting to present
to the Tribunal some details on the conduct of the Germans in
Luxembourg. The Government of the Grand Duchy has submitted
a general summary of its accusations which has been lodged with
the Tribunal as Document Number UK-77 and in which an extract
covering the crimes against property, the economic section, is in the
document book under the Number RF-194.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans, shortly after their entry into the Grand Duchy,
proceeded to annex it in fact. This attitude, similar enough to that
adopted towards the inhabitants of the Departments of Moselle,
Bas-Rhin, and Haut-Rhin, calls for some remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As was their wont, one of the first measures they put into effect
was the exchange of the Luxembourg money at the rate of 10
Luxembourg francs to 1 mark. This was the subject of the ordinance
of 26 August 1940, to be found in the document book under
Number 195 (Document Number RF-195). This rate of exchange did
not correspond to the respective purchasing power of the two
currencies. It constituted a considerable levy on the wealth of the
inhabitants and especially assured the Germans of a complete
seizure of the monies. It thus procured for them the means for
seizing a considerable part of the reserves of raw materials and
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
manufactured goods of the country. The purchases were paid for
in depreciated marks on the basis of controlled prices imposed by
the Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, by the Ordinance of 29 January 1941, the Reichsmark
was introduced as the only legal tender (ordinance submitted as
Document Number RF-196). The Luxembourg francs and the Reichskreditkasse
notes were taken out of circulation, as well as Belgian
francs, up to then considered as currency of the Franco-Luxembourg
monetary union. All of these became foreign currency, as from
5 February 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to draw the attention of the Tribunal to the fact
that of all the countries occupied by Germany, Luxembourg is, like
Alsace and Lorraine, one of the few countries which was totally
deprived of its national currency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, to procure for the Reich the financial means necessary
for the prosecution of the war, the ordinance of 27 August 1940
(Document Number RF-197) prescribed compulsory delivery of gold
and foreign currency. Moreover, the same ordinance stipulated
that foreign shares and bonds had to be offered for sale to the Reichsbank
at rates and under conditions fixed by the occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As has already been pointed out, the Germans seized industrial
stocks. In this respect, the report dated 21 May 1940, on the economic
situation in Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, contains information
on the stocks found in the country:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1,600 million tons of iron ore; 125,000 tons of manganese; 10,000
tons of crude iron; 10,000 tons of ferro-manganese; 36,000 tons of
plated products and finished products, and I could continue this
enumeration. The German seizure spread from stocks to the
management of the industrial production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the memorandum presented by the Reparations
Commission of the Luxembourg Government, Document Number
RF-198, the total economic damages amount to 5,800 million
Luxembourg francs at the 1933 value. This figure can be analyzed
as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Industry and commerce, 1,900 million; Railroads, 200 million;
Roads and Highways, 100 million; Agriculture, 1,600 million; Damage
to property in general, 1,900 million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the same official source, the total loss in capital represents
about 33 percent of the national wealth of Luxembourg, before the
war estimated at approximately 5,000 million Luxembourg francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect on the financial and monetary situation of the country
was a loss exceeding 6,000 million Luxembourg francs. In these
damages the increase in circulation of money and the amount of
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
forced investments in Germany—more than 4,800 million Luxembourg
francs—as well as an additional charge imposed upon the
taxpayers of the Grand Duchy following the introduction of the
German fiscal system figure particularly. To these burdens must
be added the skimming of profits, fines, and the allegedly voluntary
gifts of every kind imposed upon Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar to what was done in other countries, the Ordinance of
21 February 1941 (Document Number RF-199, Exhibit Number
RF-199 of the document book concerning Luxembourg) provided
that no German managers could be appointed in large enterprises,
particularly in smelting works, who—and this is the text of the
ordinance—“would not be prepared to favor the interests of Germanism
in every circumstance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of these commissioners was to insure for the Reich,
within the scope of the Four Year Plan, the direction and control
of exploitation in the exclusive interest of the German war effort.
Thus, on 2 August 1940, the “Reichskommissar” for the administration
of enemy property appointed to the largest metal company
in Luxembourg, the United Steel Works of Burbach-Eich-Dudelange
(Arbed), three German commissioners who ensured the complete
control of the company. Neither did other large companies escape
this domination as can be seen from the documents submitted to
the Tribunal under Number 200 (Document Number RF-200).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spoliation of Luxembourg and foreign interests in the insurance
field, one of the most important branches of Luxembourg’s
activities, was complete. With the exception of three Swiss companies
and a German company, all transactions were prohibited to
the Luxembourg companies, whose assets were transferred to German
insurance companies—in an official way as regards the national
companies, and secretly as regards the foreign companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The insurance companies of Luxembourg were deprived of the
premiums from fire insurance by the introduction of compulsory
fire insurance, for which the German companies were given the
monopoly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Introducing in Luxembourg their racial policy, the National
Socialists seized and confiscated all Jewish property in the Grand
Duchy to the profit of the “Verwaltung für die Judenvermögen”
(Administration of Jewish Property).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also in regard to the Umsiedlungspolitik (resettlement policy),
1,500 families (that is 7,000 Luxembourg persons) were deported.
The Germans took possession of their property. A German trust
company, set up in the German Office for Colonization and Germanization,
was charged with the administration of this property, and,
in fact, set about to liquidate it. Important assets were thus confiscated
and transferred to the Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Germans from the Tyrol were, as has already been pointed out,
installed in the buildings, and industrial, commercial, and artisan
enterprises of the deportees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is to say, Your Honors, that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
was the victim of economic pillage as systematically organized
as that in Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Delpech, the Tribunal is grateful to you
for the way in which you have performed the task which they asked
you to perform last night, a task which is not altogether easy, of
shortening the address which you had intended to make. As far
as they are able to judge, no essential parts of your address have
been omitted. It is of great importance that the Trial should be
conducted, as the Charter indicates, in an expeditious way, and it
was for this reason that the Tribunal asked you, if you could, to
shorten your address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DELPECH: I thank you, Your Honor, for your kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, M. Gerthoffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. CHARLES GERTHOFFER (Assistant Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Mr. President, Your Honors, I come to the sixth section
of this presentation, which deals with the economic pillage of
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Germans invaded France, they found there considerable
wealth. They set about with ingenuity to seize it and also to
subjugate the national production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they failed to attain their ends by mere requisitions, they
resorted to devious methods, using simultaneously ruse and violence,
striving to cloak their criminal actions with legality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To accomplish this, they misused the conventions of the armistice.
These, in fact, did not contain any economic clauses and did not
include any secret provisions but consisted only of regulations,
which were published. Nevertheless, the Germans utilized two
clauses to promote their undertakings. I submit to the Tribunal
as Document Number RF-203 a copy of the Armistice Conventions,
and I cite Article 18, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The maintenance costs of German occupation troops in
French territory will be charged to the French Government.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This clause was not contrary to the regulations of the Hague
Conventions, but Germany imposed payment of enormous sums,
far exceeding those necessary for the requirements of an occupation
army. Thus she was enabled to dispose, without furnishing any
compensation, of nearly all the money which, in fact, was cleverly
transformed into an instrument of pillage.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 17 of the Armistice Convention reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The French Government undertakes to prevent any transfer
of economic securities or stocks from the territory to be
occupied by the German troops into the non-occupied area
or into a foreign country. Those securities and stocks in the
occupied territory can be disposed of only in agreement with
the Reich Government, it being understood that the German
Government will take into account what is vitally necessary
for the population of the non-occupied territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently the purpose of this clause was to prevent things of
any kind which might be utilized against Germany from being sent
to England or to any of the colonies. But the occupying power took
advantage of this to get control of production and the distribution
of raw materials throughout France, since the non-occupied zone
could not live without the products of the occupied zone and
vice versa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This intention of the Germans is proved particularly by Document
Number 1741-PS which was discovered by the American
army, and which I now submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number
RF-204.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not want to trouble the Tribunal by reading this long
document, I shall give only a short summary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a secret report, dated 5 July 1940 addressed to the President
of the Council .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Gerthoffer, as this is not a document
of which we can take judicial notice, I think you must read
anything that you wish to put in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: I shall read a passage of the document to
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: “Article 17 grants Germany the right to
seize the securities and economic reserves in occupied territory,
and any arrangements of the French Government are subject
to approval by Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk105'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In compliance with the request of the French Government,
Germany has agreed that when considering applications of
the French Government regarding the disposal of securities
and reserves in the occupied zone, she will also take into
consideration the needs of the inhabitants of the non-occupied
zone.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall cite only this passage in order to shorten my explanatory
remarks, and I now come to the following document, which is in
the nature of a reply to the German official who drew up this
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
report, a document which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-205
(Document Number EC-409) and which is a document found by the
American army. Here is the reply to the document from which
I just quoted one passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The elimination of the demarcation line is now out of the
question, and if the revival of the economic life of France
is thereby paralyzed, that is quite immaterial to us. The
French have lost the war and must pay for the damages.
Upon my objection that France would then soon become a
center of unrest, I was answered that either shots would
settle that or the occupation of the still free zone.</p>
<hr class='tbk106'/>
<p class='noindent'>“For all concessions we make, the French must pay dearly in
deliveries from the unoccupied zone or the colonies. We must
strive to stop non-coordination in the economic field in
France.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, another document captured by the U. S. Army which
I submit as Exhibit Number RF-206 (Document Number EC-325),
signed by Dr. Gramsch, gives us the following information:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the course of the negotiations regarding relaxation of the
restrictions of the demarcation line, it has been suggested
that the French Government seize the gold and foreign
currency in the whole of France.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further in this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The foreign currency reserves of occupied France would
strengthen our war potential. This measure could, moreover,
be used in negotiations with the French Government as a
means of pressure in order to make it show a more conciliatory
attitude in other respects.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A study of these documents shows the German intent, in
disregard of all legal principles, to get all the wealth and economy
of France under their control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through force the Germans succeeded, after one year of
occupation, in putting all or nearly all the French economy under
their domination. This is evident from an article, published by
Dr. Michel, director of the Economic Office, attached to the Military
Government in France which appeared in the <span class='it'>Berliner Börsen
Zeitung</span>, of 10 April 1942. I submit it as Document Number RF-207,
and shall read one passage from it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of the competent offices of the German military
administration should be regarded as directing ‘Economic
Direction,’ that is issuing directives and at the same time
seeing that these directives are really followed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Further, on Page 12 of the statement, Dr. Michel writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Now that the direction of raw materials and the placing of
orders has been organized and is functioning efficiently,
rigorous restrictions on consumption not important to war
economy are a matter of prime consideration in France. The
restrictions imposed upon the French population in respect
of food, clothing, footwear, and fuel, have been for some time
more severe than in the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After having shown you, Mr. President and members of the
Tribunal, in this brief introduction concerning the economic spoliation
of France, the consequences of German domination upon this
country, I give you an account of the methods employed to arrive
at such a result. This will be the purpose of the four following
chapters: German seizure of means of payment; clandestine purchases
of the black market; outwardly legal acquisitions; finally, impressment
of labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I. German seizure of means of payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seizure was the result of paying occupation costs, the
one-way clearing system, and outright seizures and levies of gold,
bank notes, foreign currency, and the imposition of collective fines
(Page 15).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indemnity for the maintenance of occupation troops:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not recapitulate the legal principles of the matter, but
shall merely confine myself to a few explanatory remarks, so that
you may realize the pressure which was brought to bear on the
leaders in order to obtain the payment of considerable sums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I have had the honor of pointing out to you, in the Armistice
Conventions the principle of the maintenance of occupation troops
is succinctly worded, with no stipulation as to the amount and
the method of collection. The Germans took advantage of this to
distort and amplify this commitment of France, which became
nothing more than a pretext for the imposition of exorbitant tribute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first sessions of the Armistice Commission, the discussions
bore on this point, while the French pointed out that they could
only be forced to pay a contractual indemnity representing the
cost of maintaining an army strictly necessary for the occupation
of the territory. The German General Mieth had to recognize the
just foundation of this claim and declared that troops which were
to fight against England would not be maintained at expense to
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is evident from an extract of the minutes of the Armistice
Commission, which I submit as Document Number RF-208. But
later this General Mieth apparently was overruled by his superiors,
since in the course of a subsequent session, 16 July 1940, without
expressly going back on his word, he declared in this respect that
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
he could not give any reply, that this question would no longer
be discussed, and that, in short, everything necessary would be
done to enable the French Government to draw up its budget. This
appears from an extract of the minutes of the Armistice Commission
which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-209.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 8 August 1940 Hemmen, Chief of the German Economic
Delegation, at Wiesbaden, forwarded a memorandum to General
Huntziger, President of the French Delegation, in which he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As at present it is impossible to assess the exact costs of
occupation, daily installments of at least 20 million Reichsmark
are required until further notice, at a rate of exchange of
1 mark to 20 French francs.</p>
<hr class='tbk107'/>
<p class='noindent'>“That is to say, 400 million French francs daily. In this
amount the costs for billeting troops were not included, but
were to be paid separately.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is found in Document 210 (Document Number RF-210), which
I submit to the Tribunal and which bears the signature of Hemmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These exorbitant requirements provoked the reply of 12 August
1940, in which it was emphasized that the amount of the daily payment
did not permit the supposition that it had been fixed in consideration
of the normal forces of an occupation army and the
normal cost of the maintenance of this army, that, moreover, such
forces as corresponded to the notified figure would be out of
proportion to anything that military precedent and the necessity
of the moment might reasonably justify. This is the content of a
note of 12 August, submitted as Document Number RF-211.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 15 August 1940 the German delegation took notice of the
fact that the French Government was ready to pay some accounts,
but in a categorical manner refused to discuss either the amount
of payment or the distinction between occupation and operation
troops. This is found in Document Number RF-212, which I submit
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 18 August the French delegation took note of the memorandum
of 15 August and made the following reply (Document Number
RF-213):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that France is to pay the costs for the maintenance of
operation troops is a demand incontestably beyond the spirit
and the provisions of the Armistice Convention.</p>
<hr class='tbk108'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the required costs are converted into francs at a rate
considerably in excess of the purchasing power of the mark
and franc respectively; furthermore, that the purchases of
the German Army in France are a means of control over the
life in this country and that they will, moreover, as the
German Government admits, partly be replaced by deliveries
in kind.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>The memorandum terminates as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In these circumstances the onerous tribute required of the
French Government appears arbitrary and exceeds to a considerable
extent what might legitimately be expected to be
demanded.</p>
<hr class='tbk109'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The French Government, always anxious to fulfill the clauses
of the Armistice Convention, can only appeal to the Reich
Government in the hope that it will take into account the
arguments presented above.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Court will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: This morning I had the honor of presenting
to the Tribunal the fact that the Germans demanded of France an
indemnity of 400 million francs a day for the maintenance of their
army of occupation. I indicated that the French leaders of that
time, without failing to recognize the principle of their obligations,
protested against the sum demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment of their arrival in France the Germans had
issued, as in the other occupied countries, Reichskreditkasse notes
and requisition vouchers over which the bank of issue had no
control and which was legal tender only in France. This issue
represented a danger, for the circulation of this currency was liable
to increase at the mere will of the occupying power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, by a decree of 17 May 1940, published in the
VOBIF of 17 May 1940, Number 7, which appears as Document
Number 214 in the document book (Exhibit Number RF-214), the
occupying power fixed the rate of the Reichsmark at 20 French
francs per mark, whereas the real parity was approximately
1 mark for 10 French francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French delegation, having become concerned over the
increasing circulation of the Reichskreditkasse notes and over the
increased volume of German purchases, as well as over the rate of
exchange of the mark, was informed by the German delegation, on
14 August 1940, of its refusal to withdraw these notes from circulation
in France. This is to be found in a letter of 14 August, which
I submit as Document Number RF-215.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occupying power thus unjustifiably created a means of
pressure upon the French Government of that time to make it yield
to its demands concerning the amount of the occupation costs, as
well as concerning the forced rate of the mark and the clearing
agreements, which will be the subject of a later chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Huntziger, President of the French delegation, addressed
several dramatic appeals to the German delegation in which he
asked that France should not be hurled over the precipice, as
shown by a teletype report addressed by Hemmen on 18 August
1940, to his Minister of Foreign Affairs, a report discovered by the
United States Army, bearing the Document Number 1741-PS(5),
which I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-216. Here
is the interesting passage of this report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“These large payments would enable Germany to buy up the
whole of France, including its industries and foreign investments,
which would mean the ruin of France.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter and a note of 20 August, the German delegation
summoned the French delegation to make partial payments,
specifying that no distinction would be made between the German
troops in France, that the strength of the German occupation
would have to be determined by the necessities of the conduct of
war. In addition, the fixing of the rate of the mark would be
inoperative as far as the payments were concerned, since they
would constitute only payments on account. I submit the note of
the 20th of August of the German Government as Document
Number RF-217.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, 21 August 1940, General Huntziger, in the course
of an interview with Hemmen, made a last vain attempt to obtain
a reduction in the German demands. According to the minutes of
this interview (Document Number RF-218), Germany was already
considering close economic collaboration between herself and
France through the creation of commissioners of exchange control
and of foreign trade. At the same time Hemmen pledged elimination
of the demarcation line between the two zones. But he refused
to discuss the question of the amount of the occupation costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a note of 26 August 1940, the French Government indicated
that it considered itself obliged to yield under pressure and
protested against the German demands; this note ended with the
following passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The French nation fears neither work nor suffering, but it
must be allowed to live. This is why the French Government
would be unable in the future to continue along the road to
which it is committed if experience showed that the extent
of the demands of the government of the Reich is incompatible
with this right to live.” (Document Number RF-219.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans had the incontestable intention of utilizing the
sums demanded as occupation costs, not only for the maintenance,
the equipment, and the armament of their troops in France, or
for operations based in France, but also for other purposes. This is
shown in particular in a teletype from the Supreme Command of
the Army, dated 2 September 1940, discovered by the United States
Army, which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-220 (Document
Number EC-204). There is a passage from this teletype message
which I shall read to the Tribunal (Page 22):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To the extent to which the incoming amounts in francs are
not required for the troops in France, the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces reserves for itself the right to make
further use of the money. In particular, the allocation of
the money to any offices not belonging to the Armed Forces
must be authorized by the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces, in order to insure definitely that, first, the entire
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
amount of francs required by the Armed Forces shall be
covered and that thereafter any possible surplus shall remain
at the disposal of the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces for purposes important to the Four Year Plan.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From another teletype message, which was seized in the same
manner and which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-221 (Document
Number EC-201), I read the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is clear that there was no agreement at all with the
French as to what should be understood by ‘costs for
maintenance of occupation troops’ in France. If we are in
agreement among ourselves that at the present moment we
must, for practical reasons, avoid interminable discussions
with the French, on the other hand there must be no doubt
that we have the right to interpret the term ‘maintenance’
in the broadest possible sense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further on in the same teletype, Page 24, Paragraph 2, there
is the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In any case, the concessions demanded by the French on the
question of specifying the amount of occupation costs and of
the utilization of the francs thus delivered must be rejected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And finally the following paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The utilization of sums paid in francs.</p>
<hr class='tbk110'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Concerning the use of the francs paid which are not really
required for the costs of the maintenance of the occupation
troops in France, there can, of course, be no discussion with
French authorities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The French then attempted, in vain, to obtain a reduction in the
occupation costs and also a modification in the rate of the mark,
but the Germans refused all discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of the year 1941, negotiations were resumed.
In view of the intransigence of the Germans, the French Government
suspended payments in the month of May 1941. Then, at the
insistence of the occupying powers, they resumed it, but paid only
300 million francs a day. This is found in the document submitted
as Document Number RF-222.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 15 December 1942, after the invasion of the entire French
territory, Germany demanded that the daily payment of 300 million
francs be raised to 500 million a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sums paid for the occupation troops increased to a total of
631,866 million francs, or at the imposed rate, 31,593,300,000 marks.
This amount is not only to be gathered from the information given
by the French administration, but can also be verified by German
documents, in particular by the report of Hemmen.
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Hemmen, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin,
had been designated President of the German economic delegation
of the Armistice Commission, and he was acting, in fact, under the
direct orders of his Minister, Von Ribbentrop, as a veritable dictator
in economic questions. His chief assistant in Paris was Dr. Michel,
of whom we have already spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While maintaining his functions as chief of the economic delegation
of the Armistice Commission of Wiesbaden, the same Hemmen
was to be appointed by a decision of Hitler, under date of
19 December 1942, Reich Government delegate for economic
questions, attached to the French Government. This is verified in
the document submitted as Exhibit Number RF-223 (Document
Number 1763-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hemmen periodically sent secret economic reports to his
minister. These documents were discovered by the United States
Army. They are of a fundamental importance in this part of the
Trial, since, as you will see, they contain Germany’s admission of
economic pillage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These voluminous reports are submitted as Exhibits Numbers
RF-224, 225, 226, 227, 228, and 229 (Documents Numbers 1986-PS,
1987-PS, 1988-PS, 1989-PS, 1990-PS, 1991-PS) of the French documentation.
It is not possible for me, in view of their length, to read
them in their entirety to the Tribunal. I shall confine myself to
giving a few brief extracts therefrom in the course of my presentation.
To show their importance, here is the translation of the last
volume of the Hemmen reports. In this last report, printed in
Salzburg on 15 December 1944, on Page 26, Hemmen recognizes
that France has paid by way of indemnity for the maintenance of
occupation troops 31,593,300,000 marks, that is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Gerthoffer, these documents are in German,
are they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: Yes, Mr. President, they are in German.
I have only been able to have the last one translated into French.
Because of their length it has not been possible for me to have all
the translations made, but it is from the last volume, which is
translated into French, that I will make certain very brief quotations
by way of proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, well then are you confining yourself
to the last document, and to certain passages in the last document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: I shall limit myself to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then, as these are not documents of
which we can take judicial notice, only the parts which you read
will be regarded as part of the Record, and be treated as in
evidence.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: This enormous sum imposed was much
greater than Germany was entitled to demand. In spite of the
enormous sums which the Germans may have spent in France
during the first two years, they were not able to use a sum less
than half of that for which they were credited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is shown in the Hemmen report, where on Page 27 (Page 59
of the French translation) he gives a summary of the French
payments made as occupational indemnity, and the German
expenses in millions of marks corresponding to these expenses. This
summary is very short. I shall read it to the Tribunal. It will
constitute a German proof in support of my presentation.</p>

</table>

<p class='noindent'>This makes from 1940 to 1944 a total amount of 31,593,300,000
marks paid by the French and 31,317 million marks of German
expenditure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figures contained in this table unquestionably constitute
the German admission of the exorbitance of the indemnity for the
maintenance of occupation troops, for Germany was not able to
utilize the credit at its disposal. Most of it served to finance
expenses relative to armament, operation troops, and feeding of
Germany. This is shown by Document Number EC-232, which I
submit as Exhibit Number RF-230.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the calculation of the “Institut de Conjoncture,”
the maximum sum of the indemnity which could be exacted was
74,531,800,000 francs, taking as a basis the average daily costs of
upkeep per troop unit during the Allied occupation of the Rhineland
in 1919, namely the sum of seventeen francs or twenty-one
francs with billeting, which was at that time provided by the
German Government. According to the report on the average cost
of living (coefficient -3.14) the sum of 21 francs should correspond
to 66 francs at the 1939 value when applying the coefficient of
depreciation of the franc during the occupation, that is 2.10 percent,
or a daily average cost of 139 francs per day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Granting that the real costs of the occupation army were half
of those calculated by Hemmen, that is to say, 27,032,279,120 marks,
this sum is still lower than the 74,531,800,000 calculated by the
Institut de Conjoncture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even accepting the calculation most favorable to the accused,
one can estimate that the indemnity imposed without justification
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
amounted to 631,866 million less 74,531,800,000, that is, 557,334,200,000
francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his final report, Page 10, and Page 22 of the French translation,
Hemmen writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. during the 4 years which have elapsed since conclusion
of the Armistice, there has been paid for occupation costs
and billeting 34,000 million Reichsmark, or 680,000 million
francs. France thus contributed approximately 40 percent of
the total cost of occupation and war contributions raised in
all the occupied and Allied countries. This represents a charge
of 830 Reichsmark, or 16,600 francs, per head of the
population.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the second part of this chapter we shall examine briefly the
question of clearing. The Tribunal is acquainted with the functioning
of clearing, and I shall not revert to this. I shall indicate
under what conditions the French Government at the time was
made to sign agreements which were imposed upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parallel to the discussions relative to the indemnity for the
maintenance of occupation troops, discussions were entered into
concerning a Clearing Agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 24 July 1940 the German Delegation announced that it
would shortly submit a project. On 8 August 1940 Hemmen
submitted to the French Delegation a project of a Franco-German
arrangement for payment by compensation. This project, which
I submit as Document Number RF-231(bis) of the French documentation,
shows arbitrary provisions, which could not be voluntarily
accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It provided for financial transfers from France to Germany
without any equivalent in financial transfers from Germany to
France. It fixed the rate of exchange at 20 francs for 1 Reichsmark
by a unilateral and purely arbitrary decision, whereas the rate on
the Berlin Exchange was approximately 17.65 and the real parity
of the two currencies, taking into account their respective
purchasing power on both markets, was approximately ten francs
for one Reichsmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Page 34. The French Delegation of the Armistice Commission
submitted unsuccessfully a counter project, on 20 August
1940, and attempted to obtain a modification of the most unfavorable
clauses. I submit this project as Document Number RF-232.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 August 1940, the French delegation at the Armistice Commission
brought up in detail the question of the parity of the franc
and the Reichsmark. It called attention to the fact that the prohibition
of the financial transfers from Germany to France would
create gross inequality, whereas the transfers in the other direction
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
were organized, and this meant the French Government giving its
agreement to a veritable expropriation of French creditors. An
extract from this report is submitted as Document Number RF-233.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter of 31 August, General Huntziger again took up in
vain the argument concerning the Franc-Reichsmark rate of
exchange. I submit this letter as Document Number RF-234.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 6 September 1940 the French delegation made a new attempt
to obtain a modification of the most unfavorable clauses in the draft
of the Clearing Agreement, but it encountered an absolute refusal.
The German delegation meant to impose under the cloak of a
bilateral agreement a project elaborated by it alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote a passage from the minutes of the Armistice Delegation
(Document Number RF-235). Herr Schone, the German delegate,
stated: “I cannot reopen the discussion on this question. I can make
no concession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the Franc-Reichsmark rate of exchange, on 4 October
1940 Hemmen notified the French delegation that the rate of
20 francs must be considered as definite and according to his own
words “this is no longer to be discussed.” He added that if the
French for their part refused to conclude the payment agreement,
that is to say, the arbitrary contract imposed by Germany, he
would advise the Führer of this and that all facilities with regard
to the demarcation line would be stopped. I submit as Document
Number RF-236 this passage of the minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in the course of the negotiations which followed on
10 October 1940, the French delegation attempted for the last time
to obtain an alleviation of the drastic conditions which were
imposed upon it, but the Germans remained intransigent and
Hemmen declared in particular .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Gerthoffer, do these negotiations lead up
to a conclusion, because if they do, would it not be sufficient for
your purpose to give us the conclusion without giving all the
negotiations which lead up to it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: Mr. President, I am just finishing the statement
with the last quotation, in which the Tribunal will see what
pressure, what threats, were made upon the French, who were then
in contact with the Germans. I shall have concluded the discussion
on clearing with this quotation, if the Tribunal will allow it, it
will be a short one and it will then be finished:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“You are attempting to make the rate of the mark fictitious.
I beg you to warn your government that we shall break off
negotiations. I have in fact foreseen that you would be
unable to prevent prices from rising, but export prices are
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
rising systematically. We shall find other means of achieving
our aims. We shall get the bauxite ourselves.” (Document
Number RF-237.)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is the end of the quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the Tribunal will allow me a very brief comment. At
the Armistice Commission all kinds of economic questions were
discussed; and the French delegates resisted, for Germany wanted
to seize immediately the bauxite beds which were in the unoccupied
zone. This last sentence is the threat: if you do not accept our
Clearing Agreement, we shall seize the bauxite. That is to say, we
shall occupy by force of arms the free zone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called compensation agreement worked only to Germany’s
advantage. The results of the agreement are the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment of liberation the total transfer from France to
Germany amounted to 221,114 million francs, while the total
transfer from Germany to France amounted to 50,474 million francs.
The difference—that is, 170,640 million francs credit balance on the
French account—represents the means of payment which Germany
improperly obtained through the functioning of the clearing which
she had imposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the third part of this chapter, which will be very
brief. This is the seizure of goods and collective fines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the transactions which were outwardly legal, the Germans
proceeded to make seizures and impose collective fines in
violation of the principles of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, a contribution of 1,000 million francs was imposed upon
the French Jews on 17 December 1941 without any pretext. This
is shown in the documents submitted as Document Number RF-239
and cannot be contested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, a certain number of collective fines were imposed.
The amount actually known to the Finance Ministry amounts to
412,636,550 francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirdly, the Germans proceeded to make immediate seizure of
gold. Even Hemmen admits in his last secret report, on Pages 33
and 34, Page 72 of the French translation, that on 24 September
1940 the Germans seized 257 kilograms of gold from the port of
Bayonne, which represents at the 1939 rate 12,336,000 francs; and
in July 1940 they seized a certain number of silver coins amounting
to 55 millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still following the secret report of Hemmen, for the period
between 1 January to 30 June 1942 Germany had seized in France
221,730 kilograms of gold belonging to the Belgian National Bank,
which represents at the 1939 rate the sum of 9,500 million francs.
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible for me to present in detail the conditions under
which the Belgian gold was delivered to the Germans. This
question in itself would involve me in an explanation which would
take up several sessions. The fact is undeniable since it is admitted
by Hemmen. I shall simply indicate that as early as the month of
September 1940, in violation of international law, Hemmen had
insisted on the delivery of this gold, which had, in May 1940, been
entrusted by the National Bank of Belgium to the Bank of France.
Moreover, these facts are part of the accusations made against the
ex-ministers of the Vichy Government before the High Court of
Justice in Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The results of this procedure were long, and frequent discussions
took place at the Armistice Commission, and an agreement was
concluded on 29 October 1940, but was in fact not carried out
because of difficulties raised by the French and Belgians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the former Assistant Director of the Bank of
France, the German pressure became stronger and stronger. Laval,
who was then determined to pay any price for the authorization
to go to Berlin, where he boasted that he would be able to achieve
a large scale liberation of prisoners, the reduction of the occupation
costs, as well as the elimination of the demarcation line, yielded
to the German demands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, this gold was delivered to the Reichsbank and was requisitioned
by order of the Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan. The
documents relative to this question are submitted as Document
Number RF-240.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall simply add that after the liberation the Provisional
Government of the French Republic transferred to the National
Bank of Belgium a quantity of gold equal to that which the Belgian
Bank had entrusted to the Bank of France in the month of May 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To conclude the gold question I shall indicate to the Tribunal
that Germany was unable to obtain the gold reserve of the Bank
of France, for it had been put in safekeeping in good time. Finally,
still according to the last secret report of Hemmen, Pages 29 and 49
of the French translation, at the moment of their retreat the
Germans seized without any right the sum of 6,899 million francs
from branches of the Bank of France in Nancy, Belfort, and Epinal.
Document 1741-PS (24). (Exhibit Number RF-241.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>I note for the Record that during the occupation the Germans
seized great quantities of gold which they arranged to be bought
from private citizens by intermediaries. I cannot give figures for
this. I simply touch on the question for the Record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we summarize the question of the means of payment which
Germany unduly requisitioned in France, we shall reach—still
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
taking the calculation most favorable to the defendants and taking
the maximum amount for the cost of maintaining occupation
troops—a minimum total of 745,833,392,550 francs, in round figures
750,000 million francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to Page 50, that is to say the use which the Germans
made of these considerable sums; and first of all, the black market
organized by the occupying power. Here again I don’t want to take
advantage of your kind attention. I have had the honor of
presenting to you the mechanism of the black market in all the
occupied countries. I have indicated how it arose, how the Germans
utilized it, how, under the orders of the Defendant Göring, it was
organized and exploited. I do not wish to revert to this, and I shall
pass over the whole section of my written exposé which was
devoted to the black market in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come to Page 69 of my written exposé. Chapter 3: Ostensibly
legal acquisitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the pressure of the Germans, the Vichy Government had
to consent to reserve for them a very high quota of products of
all kinds. In exchange the Germans undertook to furnish raw
materials, the quantities of which were determined by them alone.
But these raw materials, when they were delivered, which was
not always the case, were for the most part absorbed by the
industry which was forced to supply them with finished products.
In fact, there was no compensation, since the occupiers got back in
the form of finished products the raw materials delivered and did
not in reality give anything in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the report of the Economic Control which has already been
quoted, submitted as Document Number RF-107, the following
example may be noted which I shall read to the Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“An agreement permitted the purchase in the free zone of
5,000 trucks destined for the German G.B.K., whereby the
Reich furnished five tons of steel per vehicle or a total of
25,000 tons of steel destined for French industry. In view of
the usual destination of the products of our metal industry
at that time, this was obviously a one-sided bargain, indeed
if our information is exact, the deliveries of steel to be made
in return were not even fulfilled, and they were partly used
for the defense of the Mediterranean coast, rails, antitank
defenses, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is appropriate to call attention to the fact that a considerable
part of the levies in kind were the object of no regulation whatever,
either because the Germans remained debtors in these transactions,
or that they considered without justification that these levies
constituted war booty.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In regard to this there are no documents available; however, the
United States Army has discovered a secret report of one called
Kraney, the representative of Roges, an organization which was
charged with collecting both war booty and purchases on the black
market. It appears from this report that in September 1944, the
Roges had resold to Germany for 10,858,499 marks, or 217,169,980
francs, objects seized in the southern zone as war booty. I submit
this document as Exhibit Number RF-244.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of the means of payment exacted by Germany and
of requisitions regulated by her, or not, France was literally
despoiled. Enormous quantities of articles of all kinds were removed
by the occupiers. According to information given by the French
statistical services, preliminary estimates of the minimum of these
levies have been made. These estimates do not include damages
resulting from military operations, but solely the German spoliations,
computed in cases of doubt at a minimum figure. They will
be summarized in the eight following sections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Levies of agricultural produce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit as Document Number RF-245, the report of the Ministry
of Agriculture and a statistical table drawn up by the Institut de
Conjoncture, summarizing the official German levies which included
neither individual purchases nor black market purchases which
were both considerable. It is not possible for me to read to the
Tribunal a table as long as this; I shall confine myself to giving
a brief résumé of this statistical table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here are some of the chief agricultural products which were
seized and their estimate in thousands of francs (I am indicating
the totals in round figures): Cereals, 8,900,000 tons, estimate 22 million
francs; meat, 900,000 tons, estimate 30 million; fish, 51,000 tons,
estimate 1 million; wines, liquors, 13,413,000 hectoliters, estimate
18,500,000; colonial products, 47,000 tons, estimate 805,900; horses
and mules, 690,000 head; wood, 36 million cubic meters; sugar,
11,600,000 tons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass over the details. The Germans settled through
clearing and by means of occupation costs 113,620,376,000 francs; the
balance, that is 13,000 million, was not settled in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, these estimates do not include considerable damage
caused to forests as a result of abnormal cutting and the reduction
of areas under cultivation. There is no mention, either, of the
reduction in livestock and damage caused by soil exhaustion. This
is a brief summary of the percentage of official German levies on
agriculture in relation to the total French production: Wheat,
13 percent; oats, 75 percent; hay and straw, 80 percent; meat,
21 percent; poultry, 35 percent; eggs, 60 percent; butter, 20 percent;
preserved fish, 30 percent; champagne, 56 percent; wood for
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
industrial uses, 50 percent; forest fuels, 50 percent; alcohol, 25 percent.
These percentages, I repeat, do not include quantities of produce
which the Germans bought up either by individual purchases or on
the black market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have had the privilege of presenting to you the fact that these
operations were of a considerable scope and amounted for France
approximately to several hundred thousand millions of francs. The
quantities of agricultural produce thus taken from French
consumers are incalculable. I shall simply indicate that wines,
champagne, liquors, meat, poultry, eggs, butter were the object of
a very considerable clandestine traffic to the benefit of the Germans
and that the French population, except for certain privileged
persons, was almost entirely deprived of these products.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Section 2 of this chapter I shall discuss the important question
concerning levies of raw materials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That would be a good time for us to adjourn
for ten minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: The summary of the levies in raw materials
from the statistical point of view is contained in charts which I shall
not take the time to read to the Tribunal. I shall submit them as
Document Number RF-246 and point out that the total amount of
these supplies reaches the sum of 83,804,145,000 francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Pages 77 to 80 of my written statement I had thought it
necessary to make a summary of these charts, but I consider it is
not possible to read even the summary because the figures are
too numerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to information provided by the French administration,
of that sum the Germans settled, by way of occupation costs and
clearing, only 59,254,639,000 francs, leaving the difference of
19,506,109,000 francs charged to the French Treasury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The percentage of the German levies in relation to the whole
French production can be summarized in a chart which I have
given in my brief and I ask the Tribunal for permission to read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The percentage of levies of raw materials in relation to
French production: Coal, 29 percent; electric power, 22
percent; petroleum and motor fuel, 80 percent; iron ore,
74 percent; steel products, crude and half finished, 51 percent;
copper, 75 percent; lead, 43 percent; zinc, 38 percent; tin,
67 percent; nickel, 64 percent; mercury, 50 percent; platinum,
76 percent; bauxite, 40 percent; aluminum, 75 percent;
magnesium, 100 percent; sulphur carbonate, 80 percent;
industrial soap, 67 percent; vegetable oil, 40 percent; carbosol,
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
100 percent; rubber, 38 percent; paper and cardboard,
16 percent; wool, 59 percent; cotton, 53 percent; flax, 65
percent; leather, 67 percent; cement, 55 percent; lime,
20 percent; acetone, 21 percent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This enumeration permits us to consider that officially about
three-quarters of the raw materials were seized by the occupying
power, but these statistics must be qualified in two ways: A large
part of the quota of raw materials theoretically left to the French
economy was in fact reserved for priority industries, that is to say,
those industries whose production was reserved for the occupying
power. Secondly, these requisitions and percentages include only
the figures of official deliveries; but we have seen that the Germans
acquired considerable quantities of raw materials from the black
market, especially precious metals: gold, platinum, silver, radium,
or rare metals, such as mercury, nickel, tin and copper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, one can say in general that the raw materials which
were left for the needs of the population were insignificant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I come to Section 3: Levies of manufactured goods and
products of the mining industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I had the honor to point out to you in my general remarks,
the Germans, using divers means of pressure, succeeded in utilizing
directly or indirectly the greater part of the French industrial
production. I shall not go over these facts again and I shall
immediately pass to a summary of the products which were
delivered. I submit as Document Number RF-248 a chart which
contains statistical data, according to industries, of levies by the
occupying power of manufactured goods during the course of the
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not want to tax the patience of the Tribunal by reading
this; I shall simply cite the summary of this chart, which is as
follows: Orders for products finished and invoiced from 25 June
1940 until the liberation—Mechanical and electrical industries,
59,455 million; chemical industry, 11,744 million; textiles and
leather, 15,802 million; building and construction material, 56,256
million; mines (coal, aluminum, and phosphates), 4,160 million; iron
industry, 4,474 million; motor fuel, 568 million; naval construction,
6,104 million; aeronautical construction, 23,620 million; miscellaneous
industries, 2,457 million; making a total of 184,640 million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These statistics should be commented upon as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) The information which is contained here does not include
the production of the very industrialized departments of Nord and
of Pas de Calais, attached to the German administration of Brussels,
nor does it include the manufactures of the Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin,
and Moselle departments, actually incorporated into the Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>2) Out of the total sum of 184,640 million francs worth of
supplies, the information which we have to date does not as yet
permit us to fix the amount regulated by the Germans by way of
either occupation costs or clearing, or the balance which was not
made the subject of any settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3) If, on the basis of contracts, one made an estimate of the
industrial production levied by Germany in the departments of
Nord and Pas de Calais, one would obtain a figure for those two
departments of 18,500 million, which would bring the approximate
total up to more than 200,000 million francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extent of the German levies on manufactured products is
summarized in the following chart which I submit to the Tribunal,
and which I have summarized on Page 87 of my written statement.
I shall take the liberty of reading it once more to the Tribunal.
It will show the proportion of the manufactured goods which
the French population was deprived of: Automobile construction,
70 percent; electrical and radio construction, 45 percent; industrial
precision parts, 100 percent; heavy castings, 100 percent; foundries,
46 percent; chemical industries, 34 percent; rubber industry,
60 percent; paint and varnish, 60 percent; perfume, 33 percent;
wool industry, 28 percent; cotton weaving, 15 percent; flax and
cotton weaving, 12 percent; industrial hides, 20 percent; buildings
and public works, 75 percent; woodwork and furniture, 50 percent;
lime and cement, 68 percent; naval construction, 79 percent;
aeronautic construction, 90 percent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scrutiny of this chart leads to the following remarks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proportion of entirely finished products is very large, for
instance: automobiles, 70 percent; precision instruments, 100 percent;
heavy castings, 100 percent; whereas, the proportion of the products
in the process of manufacture is not as great, for example: foundry,
46 percent; chemical industry, 34 percent; <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This state of affairs results from the fact that the Germans
directed the products in the process of manufacture—in theory
reserved for the French population—into finishing industries which
had priority, that is to say, whose production was reserved for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, through their purchases on the black market, the
Germans procured an enormous quantity of textiles, machine tools,
leather, perfumes, and so forth. The French population was almost
completely deprived of textiles, in particular, during the occupation.
That is also the case as regards leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I reach Section 4: the removal of industrial tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not impose on your time. This question has already been
treated as far as the other occupied countries are concerned. I
would merely point out that in France it was the subject of
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
statistical estimates which I submit to you as Document Number
RF-251. These statistical estimates show that the value of the
material which was removed from the various French factories,
either private or public enterprise, exceeds the sum of 9,000 million
francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was observed that for many of the machines which were
removed, the Germans merely indicated the inventory values after
reduction for depreciation and not the replacement value of the
machines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to Section 5: Securities and Foreign Investments.
In Document EC-57, which I submitted as Exhibit Number RF-105
at the beginning of my presentation, I had indicated that the
Defendant Göring himself had informed you of the aims of the
German economic policy and he ventured to say that the extension
of German influence over foreign enterprises was one of the
purposes of German economic policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These directives were to be expressed much more precisely in
the document of the 12th of August 1940, which I submit as Exhibit
Number RF-252 (Document Number EC-40), from which I shall
read a short extract:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since”—as the document says—“the principal economic
enterprises are in the form of stock companies, it is first of
all indispensable to secure the ownership of securities in
France.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further on it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The exerting of influence by way of ordinances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the document indicates all the means to be employed to
achieve this, in particular this passage concerning international law:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to Article 46 of the Hague Convention concerning
Land Warfare, private property cannot be confiscated. Therefore
the confiscation of securities is to be avoided in so far as
it does not concern state owned property. According to
Article 42 and following of the Hague Convention concerning
Land Warfare, the authority exercising power in the occupied
enemy territory must restrict itself in principle to utilizing
measures which are necessary to re-establish or maintain
public order and public life. According to international law
it is forbidden in principle to eliminate the still existing
boards of companies and to replace them by ‘commissioners.’
Such a measure would, from the point of view of international
law, probably not be considered as efficacious.
Consequently, we must strive to force the various functionaries
of such companies to work for German economy,
but not to dismiss those persons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Further on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If these functionaries refuse to be guided by us, we must
remove them from their posts and replace them by persons
we can use.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We will briefly consider the three categories of seizure of
financial investments, which were the purpose of German spoliation
during the occupation, and first of all the seizure of financial investments
in companies whose interests were abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 14th of August 1940 an ordinance was published in
VOBIF, Page 67 (Document Number RF-253), forbidding any
negotiations regarding credits or foreign securities. But mere
freezing of securities did not satisfy the occupying power; it was
necessary for them to become outwardly the owners of the
securities in order to be able, if necessary, to negotiate them in
neutral countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had agents who purchased foreign securities from private
citizens who needed money, but above all, they put pressure on
the Vichy Government in order to obtain the handing over of the
principal French investments in foreign countries. That is why, in
particular, after long discussions in the course of which the German
pressure was very great, considerable surrenders of securities were
made to the Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible for me to submit to the Tribunal the
numerous documents concerning the surrender of these securities:
minutes, correspondence, valuations. There would be without
exaggeration, several cubic meters of them. I shall merely quote
several passages as examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the Bor Mines Company, the copper mines in Yugoslavia
of which the greater part of the capital was in French hands,
the Germans appointed, on 26 July 1940, an administrative commissioner
for the branches of the company situated in Yugoslavia.
This is found in Document Number RF-254 which I submit to the
Tribunal. The administrative commissioner was Herr Neuhausen,
the German Consul General for Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the discussions of the Armistice Commission
Hemmen declared (extract from the minutes of 27 September 1940
at 10:30, which I submit to the Tribunal as Document Number
RF-255):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany wishes to acquire the shares of the company
without consideration for the juridical objections made by
the French. Germany obeys, in fact, the imperative consideration
of the economic order. She suspects that the Bor
Mines are still delivering copper to England and she has
definitely decided to take possession of these mines.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Faced with the refusal of the French delegates, Hemmen
declared at the meeting of 4 October 1940 (I submit to the Tribunal
an extract from the minutes of this meeting as Document Number
RF-256):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I should regret to have to transmit such a reply to my
government. See if the French Government cannot reconsider
its attitude. If not, our relations will become very difficult.
My government is anxious to bring this matter to a close. If
you refuse, the consequences will be extremely grave.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>M. de Boisanger, the French Delegate, replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I will therefore put that question once more.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And Hemmen replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall expect your reply by tomorrow. If it does not come,
I shall transmit the negative reply which you have just given.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in the course of the meeting on 9 January 1941, Hemmen
stated—I submit again an extract from the minutes, Document
Number RF-257:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At first I was entrusted with this affair at Wiesbaden. Then
it was taken over by Consul General Neuhausen on behalf of
a very high-ranking personage (Marshal Göring), and it was
handled directly in Paris by M. Laval and M. Abetz.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As far as French investments in petroleum companies in Romania
are concerned, the pressure was no less. In the course of the meeting
of 10 October 1940, of the Armistice Commission, the same Hemmen
stated (I submit as Document Number RF-258, an extract from the
minutes of the meeting):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Moreover we shall be satisfied with the majority of the
shares. We will leave in your hands anything which we do
not need for this purpose. Can you accept on this point in
principle? The matter is urgent, as for the Bor Mines. We
want all.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the 22 November 1940, Hemmen stated again (I submit this
extract of the minutes of the Armistice Commission meeting
as Document Number RF-259):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are still at war and we must exert immediate influence
over petroleum production in Romania. Therefore we cannot
wait for the peace treaty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the French delegates asked that the surrender should at
least be made in exchange for a material compensation, Hemmen
replied in the course of the same meeting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Impossible. The sums which you are to receive from us will
be taken out of the occupation costs. This will save you from
using the printing. This kind of participation will be made
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
general on the German side when the new collaboration
policy has once been defined.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We might present indefinitely quotations of this kind, and many
even much more serious from the point of view of violation of the
provisions of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these surrenders, apparently agreed to by the French, were
accepted only under German pressure. Scrutiny of the contracts
agreed upon shows great losses to those who handed over their
property and enormous profits for those who acquired it, without the
latter having furnished any real compensation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans thus obtained French shares in the Romanian
petroleum companies, in the enterprises of Central Europe, Norway,
and the Balkans, and especially those of the Bor Mines Company
which I mentioned. These surrenders paid by francs coming from
occupation costs, rose to a little more than two thousand million
francs. The others were paid by the floating of French loans abroad,
notably in Holland, and through clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having given you a brief summary of the seizure of French
business investments abroad, I shall also examine rapidly the German
seizure of registered capitals of French industrial companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after the Armistice, in conformity with the directives of
the Defendant Göring, a great number of French industries were
the object of proposals on the part of German groups anxious to
acquire all or part of the assets of these companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This operation was facilitated by the fact that the Germans, as I
have had the honor of pointing out to you, were in reality in control
of industry and had taken over the direction of production, particularly
by the system of “Paten Firmen.” Long discussions took
place between the occupying power and the French Ministry of
Finance, whose officials strove, sometimes without success, to limit
to 30 percent the maximum of German shares. It is not possible for
me to enter into details of the seizure of these shares. I shall point
out, however, that the Finance Minister handed to us a list of the
most important ones, which are reproduced in a chart appended to
the French Document Book under Document RF-260 (Exhibit
Number RF-260).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was that the seizure of shares, fictitiously paid through
clearing, reached the sum of 307,436,000 francs; through occupation
costs accounts, 160 millions; through foreign stocks a sum which
we have not been able to determine; and finally, through various
or unknown means, 28,718,000 francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall conclude the paragraph of this fifth section by quoting
part of the Hemmen report relative to these questions (Page 63 of
the original and 142 of the French translation). Here is what Hemmen
writes, in Salzburg in January 1944, concerning this subject:
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fifth report upon the activity of the delegation is devoted
to the difficulty of future seizures of shares in France, in the
face of the very challenging attitude of the French Government
concerning the surrender of valuable domestic and
foreign securities. This resistance increased during the period
covered by the report to such an extent that the French
Government was no longer disposed to give any approval to
the transfer of shares even if economic compensation were
offered.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further on, Page 63 in the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the 4 years of the occupation of France the Armistice
Delegation transferred stocks representing altogether about
121 million Reichsmark from French to German ownership,
among them shares in enterprises important for the war in
other countries, in Germany, and in France. Details of this
are found in the earlier reports of the activities of the
delegation. For about half of these transfers, economic compensation
was given on the German side by delivery of French
holdings of foreign shares acquired in Holland and in Belgium,
while the remaining amount was paid by way of clearing
or occupation costs. The use of French foreign investments
as a means of payment resulted in a difference, between the
German purchasing price and the French rate, of about
7 million Reichsmark which went to the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is reason to emphasize that the profit derived by Germany
merely from the financial point of view is not 7 million Reichsmark,
or 140 million francs according to Hemmen, but much greater. In
fact, Germany paid principally for these acquisitions with the
occupation indemnity, clearing, and French loans issued in Holland
or in Belgium, the appropriation of which by Germany amounted to
spoliation of these countries and could not constitute a real compensation
for France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These surrenders of holdings, carried out under the cloak of
legality, moved the United Nations in their declarations made in
London on 5 January 1943 to lay down the principle that such
surrenders should be declared null and void, even when carried
out with the apparent consent of those who made them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit as Document Number RF-261, the solemn statement
signed in London on 5 January 1943, which was published in the
French <span class='it'>Journal Officiel</span> on 15 August 1944, at the time of the
liberation. I might add that all these surrenders are the subject of
indictments before the French Courts of high treason against Frenchmen
who surrendered their holdings to the Germans, even though
undeniable pressure was brought to bear upon them.
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall conclude this chapter with one last observation: The
German seizure of real estate in France. It is still difficult to give
at this time a precise account of this subject, for these operations
were made most often through an intermediary with an assumed
name. The most striking is that of a certain Skolnikoff, who during
the occupation was able to invest nearly 2,000 million francs in
the purchase of real estate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This individual of indeterminate nationality, who lived in
poverty before the war, enriched himself in a scandalous fashion,
thanks to his connection with the Gestapo and his operations on
the black market with the occupying power. But whatever may
have been the profits he derived from his dishonest activities, he
could not personally have acquired real estate to the value of almost
2,000 million in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit, as Document Number RF-262, a copy of a police report
concerning this individual. It is not possible for me to read this to
the Tribunal in its entirety, but this report contains the list of the
buildings and real estate companies acquired by this individual.
These are without question choice buildings of great value. It is
evident that Skolnikoff, an agent for the Gestapo, was an assumed
name for German personalities whose identity has not been discovered
up to the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I shall take up Section 6; the requisition of transport and
communication material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A report from the French administration gives us statistics which
are reproduced in very complete charts, which I shall not read to
the Tribunal. I shall merely point out that most of the locomotives
and rolling stock in good shape were removed, and that the total
sum of the requisitions of transport material reaches the sum of
198,450 million francs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now deal with requisitions in the departments of Haut-Rhin,
Bas-Rhin, and Moselle. From the beginning of the invasion
the Germans incorporated these departments into the Reich. This
question will be presented by the French Prosecution when they
discuss the question of Germanization. From the point of view of
economic spoliation it must be stressed that the Germans sought to
derive a maximum from these three departments. If they paid in
marks for a certain number of products, they made no settlement
whatever for the principal products, especially coal, iron, crude oil,
potash, industrial material, furniture, and agricultural machinery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The information relating to this is given by the French administration
in a chart which I shall summarize briefly and which I
submit as Document Number RF-264. The value of requisitions
made in the three French departments of the east—requisitions not
paid for by the Germans—reaches the sum of 27,315 million francs.
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To conclude the question of the departments in the east, I should
like to point out to the Tribunal that my colleague, who will
discuss the question of Germanization, will show how the firm,
Hermann Göring Werke, in which the Defendant Göring had considerable
interests, appropriated equipment from mines of the
large French company called the “Petits-Fils de François de Wendel
et Cie.” (See Document RF-1300.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the Section 8, concerning miscellaneous levies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) Spoliations in Tunisia. The Germans went into Tunisia on
10 November 1942 and were driven out by the Allied Armies in
May 1943. During this period they indulged in numerous acts of
spoliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think that it is necessary to go into
details of the seizures in this part of the country if they are of the
same sort as those in other parts of the country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: Mr. President, it is similar; there is only
one difference, and that concerns the amount. I believe the principle
cannot be contested by anyone; therefore I shall go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen, I shall also pass over the question of compulsory
labor. I shall conclude my summary, however, by pointing out to
the Tribunal that French economy suffered enormous losses from
the deportation of workers, a subject which was discussed by my
colleague. We have calculated the losses in working hours and we
estimate—and this will be my only remark—that French economy
lost 12,550 million working hours through the deportation of workers,
a figure which does not include the number of workers who
were more or less forced to work for the Germans in enterprises in
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you will permit me, gentlemen, I shall conclude this presentation
concerning France by giving you a general review of the
situation; and I shall refer once more to Hemmen, the economic
dictator who actually ruined my country upon the orders of his
masters, the defendants. While in the first five reports submitted,
despite their apparently technical nature, the author shows the
assurance of the victor who can allow himself to do anything, in
the last report of 15 December 1944 at Salzburg, the only one I
shall refer to, Hemmen sought visibly, while giving his work a
technical quality, to plead the case of Germany—that of his Nazi
masters and his own case. He only succeeded, however, in bringing
forth unwittingly an implacable accusation against the nefarious
work with which he was entrusted. Here are some short extracts,
gentlemen, of Hemmen’s final report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 1 of his report, Page 2 of the French text, he implied
the co-responsibility of the German leaders, and Göring particularly.
He writes as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to the directives formulated on 5 July 1940 by
the Reich Marshal and Delegate of the Four Year Plan,
concerning the existing legal situation, the Armistice Convention
does not give us rights in the economic domain of
the unoccupied parts of France, not even when loosely interpreted.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A little farther on he admits blackmail with regard; to the
demarcation line with these words (Page 3 of the translation):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Pétain Government manifested from the beginning a
strong desire to re-establish rapidly the destroyed economy
by means of German support and to find work for the French
population in order to avoid the threat of unemployment, but
above all to reunite the two French zones, separated by the
demarcation line, into a unified economic and administrative
territory. They were at the same time willing to bring this
territory into line with German economic direction, under
French management, thoroughly reorganizing it according to
the German model.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then Hemmen adds:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In return for considerable relaxations regarding the demarcation
line, the Armistice Delegation has come to an agreement
with the French Government to introduce into French legislation
the German law, relating to foreign currency.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Farther on, concerning pressure, on Page 4, and Page 7 of the
translation, Hemmen wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thereby the automatic rise of prices aggravated by the
unchecked development of the black market was felt all the
more strongly, since wages were forcibly fixed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass over the passage in which Hemmen speaks of French
resistance. However, I should like to point out to the Tribunal that,
on Page 13—Page 29 of the translation—Hemmen tries to show
through financial evaluations and most questionable arguments that
the cost of the war per head was heavier for the Germans than
for the French. He himself destroys with one word the whole
system of defense which he had built up by writing at the end of
his bold calculations that from autumn 1940 to February 1944 the
cost of living increased 166 percent in France, while in Germany it
increased only 7 percent. Now, gentlemen, it is, I am quite sure,
through the increase in the cost of living that one measures the
impoverishment of a country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last of all, on Page 4, and this is my last quotation from the
Hemmen report, he admits the German crime in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Through the removal, for years, of considerable quantities of
merchandise of every kind without economic compensation,
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
a perceptible decrease in substance had resulted with a
corresponding increase in monetary circulation, which had led
ever more noticeably, to the phenomena of inflation and
especially to a devaluation of money and a lowering of the
purchasing power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These material losses, we may say, can be repaired. Through
work and saving we can re-establish, in a more or less distant
future, the economic situation of the country. That is true, but
there is one thing which can never be repaired—the results of
privations upon the physical state of the population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the other German crimes, such as deportations, murders,
massacres, make one shudder with horror, the crime which consisted
of deliberately starving whole populations is no less odious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the occupied countries, in France particularly, many persons
died solely because of undernourishment and because of lack of
heat. It was estimated that people require from 3,000 to 3,500
calories a day and heavy laborers about 4,000. From the beginning
of the rationing in September 1940 only 1,800 calories per day per
person were distributed. Successively the ration decreased to
1,700 calories in 1942, then to 1,500, and finally fell to 1,220 and
900 calories a day for adults and to 1,380 and 1,300 for heavy
laborers; old persons were given only 850 calories a day. But the
true situation was still worse than the ration theoretically allotted
through ration cards; in fact, frequently a certain number of coupons
were not honored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans could not fail to recognize the disastrous situation
as far as public health was concerned, since they themselves estimated
in the course of the war of 1914-1918 that the distribution
of 1,700 calories a day was a “regime of slow starvation, leading to
death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What aggravated the situation still more was the quality of the
rations which were distributed. Bread was of the poorest quality;
milk, when there was any, was skimmed to the point where the fat
content amounted to only 3 percent. The small amount of meat
given to the population was of bad quality. Fish had disappeared
from the market. If we add to that an almost total lack of clothing,
shoes, and fuel, and the fact that frequently neither schools nor
hospitals were heated, one may easily understand what the physical
condition of the population was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incurable sicknesses such as tuberculosis developed and will continue
to extend their ravages for many years. The growth of children
and adolescents is seriously impaired. The future of the race is a
cause for the greatest concern. The results of economic spoliation
will be felt for an indefinite period.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Could you tell me what evidence you have
for your figures of calories?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. GERTHOFFER: I am going to show you this at the end of
my presentation. It is a report of a professor at the Medical School
of Paris who has been specially commissioned by the Dean of the
University to make a report on the results of undernourishment.
I will quote it at the end of my statement. I am almost there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The results of this economic spoliation will be felt for an indefinite
length of time. The exhaustion is such that, despite the
generous aid brought by the United Nations, the situation of the
occupied countries, taken as a whole, is still alarming. In fact, the
complete absence of stocks, the insufficiency of the means of
production and of transport, the reduction of livestock and the
economic disorganization, do not permit the allotting of sufficient
rations at this time. This poverty, which strikes all occupied
countries, can disappear only gradually over a long period of time,
the length of which no one can yet determine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If in certain rich agricultural regions the producers were able
during the occupation to have and still do have a privileged
situation from the point of view of food supply, the same is not true
in the poorer regions nor in urban districts. If we consider that
in France the urban population is somewhat more numerous than
the rural population, we can state clearly that the great majority
of the French population was subject to and still remains subject to
a food regime definitely insufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Guy Laroche, delegated by the Dean of the Faculty of
Medicine of Paris to study the consequences of undernourishment
in France as a result of German requisitions, has just sent a report
on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not wish to prolong my explanation by reading the entire
report. I shall ask the Tribunal’s permission to quote the conclusion,
which I submit as Document Number RF-264(bis). I received the
whole report only a few days ago. It is submitted in its entirety,
but I have not been able to have 50 copies made of it. Two copies
have been made and are being submitted. Here are Dr. Laroche’s
conclusions:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We see how great the crime of rationing was, which was
imposed by the Germans upon the French during the occupation
period from 1940 to 1944. It is difficult to give exact
figures for the number of human lives lost due to excessive
rationing. We would need general statistics and these we
have been unable to establish.</p>
<hr class='tbk111'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Nevertheless, without overestimating, we may well believe
that, including patients in institutions, the loss of human
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
life from 1940 to 1944 reached at least 150,000 persons. We
must add a great number of cases which were not fatal, of
physical and mental decline often incurable, of retarded
development in children, and so forth.</p>
<hr class='tbk112'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We think that three conclusions can be drawn from this
report, which of course is incomplete:</p>
<hr class='tbk113'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1.) The German occupation authorities deliberately sacrificed
the lives of patients in institutions and hospitals.</p>
<hr class='tbk114'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2.) From the way everything happened it seemed as if they
had wished to organize, in a rational and scientific fashion,
the decline of the health of adolescents and adults.</p>
<hr class='tbk115'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3.) Suckling babies and young children received a normal
ration; it is probable that this privileged position is explained
by the fact that the Nazi leaders hoped to spread their
doctrine more easily among beings who would not have
known any other conditions of life and who would, because
of a planned education, have accepted their doctrine, for
they knew they could not expect to convince adolescents and
adults except through force.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The report is signed by Professor Guy Laroche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This report, gentlemen, has attached to it a photograph, which
you will find at the end of the document book. I beg to hand it
to you. The unfortunate beings that you see in that picture are not
the victims of a concentration or reprisal camp. They are simply
the patients of an asylum in the outskirts of Paris who fell into
this state of physical weakness as a result of undernourishment. If
these men had had the diet of the asylum prior to rationing, they
would have been as strong as normal people. Unfortunately for
them they were reduced to the official rationing and were unable
to obtain the slightest supplement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not let adversaries say: “But the German people are just as
badly off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should reply that, in the first place, this is not true. The German
did not suffer cold for four years; he was not undernourished. On
the contrary, he was well-fed, warmly clothed, warmly housed, with
products stolen from the occupied countries, leaving only the minimum
necessary for existence for the peoples of these countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remember, gentlemen, the words of Göring when he said: “If
famine is to reign, it will not reign in Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly I should say to my adversaries if they made such an
objection: The Germans and their Nazi leaders wanted the war which
they launched, but they had no right to starve other peoples in
order to carry out their attempt at world domination. If today they
are in a difficult situation, it is the result of their own behavior;
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
and they seem to me to have no right to take recourse to the
famous sentence: “I did not want that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am coming to the end of my statement. If you will permit me,
gentlemen, I will conclude in two minutes the whole of this presentation
by reminding the Tribunal in a few words what the
premeditated crime was, of which the German leaders have been
accused, from the economic point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The application of racial and living space theories was bound
to engender an economic situation which could not be solved and
force the Nazi leaders to war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a modern society because of the division of labor, of its
concentration, and of its scientific organization, the concept of
national capital takes on more and more a primary importance,
whatever may be the social principles of its distribution between
nationals, or its possession in all or in part by states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, a national capital, public or private, is constituted by the
joint effort of the labor and the savings of successive generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saving, or the putting into reserve of the products of labor as a
result of deprivations freely consented to, must exist in proportion
to the needs of the concentration of the industrial enterprises of
the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Germany, a country highly-industrialized, this equilibrium did
not exist. In fact, the expenditures, private or public, of that
country surpassed its means; saving was insufficient. The establishment
of a system of obligatory savings was formulated only through
the creation of new taxes and has never replaced true savings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of the war of 1914-1918, after having freed herself
of the burden of reparations (and I must point out that two-thirds
of the sum remained charged to France as far as this country is
concerned), Germany, who had established her gold reserve in 1926,
began a policy of foreign loans and spent without counting the
cost. Finding it impossible to keep her agreements, she found no
more creditors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Hitler’s accession to power her policy became more definite.
She isolated herself in a closed economic system, utilizing all her
resources for the preparation of a war which would permit her,
or at least that is what she hoped, to take through force the
property of her western neighbors and then to turn against the
Soviet Union in the hope of exploiting, for her profit, the immense
wealth of that great country. It is the application of the theories
formulated in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, which had as a corollary the enslavement
and then the extermination of the populations of conquered
countries.
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the occupation the invaded nations were
systematically pillaged and brutally enslaved; and this would have
permitted Germany to obtain her war aims, that is to say, to take
the patrimony of the invaded countries and to exterminate their
populations gradually, if the valor of the United Nations had not
delivered them. Instead of becoming enriched from the looted
property, Germany had to sink it into a war which she had provoked,
right up to the very moment of her collapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such actions, knowingly perpetrated and executed by the German
leaders contrary to international law and particularly contrary to
the Hague Convention, as well as the general principles of penal
law in force in all civilized nations, constitute War Crimes for
which they must answer before your high jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I should like to add that the French Prosecution had
intended to present a statement on the pillage of works of art in
the occupied countries of western Europe. But this question has
already been discussed in two briefs of our American colleagues,
briefs which seem to us to establish beyond any question the
responsibility of the defendants. In order not to prolong the hearing,
the French Prosecution feels that it is its duty to refrain from
presenting this question again; but we remain respectfully at the
disposal of the Tribunal in case, in the course of the trial, they feel
they need further information on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The presentation of the French Prosecution is concluded. I shall
give the floor to Captain Sprecher of the American Delegation,
who will make a statement on the responsibility of the Defendant
Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPTAIN DREXEL A. SPRECHER (Assistant Trial Counsel for
the United States): May it please the Tribunal, I notice that Dr.
Fritz, the defendant’s attorney, is not here; and in view of the late
hour, it would be agreeable if we hold it over until tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is 5 o’clock now, so we shall adjourn in
any event now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 23 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>FORTY-FIRST DAY</span><br/> Wednesday, 23 January 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: May it please the Tribunal, it is my responsibility
and my privilege to present today the case on the individual
responsibility of the Defendant Hans Fritzsche for Crimes against
Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanity as they relate
directly to the Common Plan or Conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the permission of the Tribunal, it is planned to make this
presentation in three principal divisions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, a short listing of the various positions held by the Defendant
Fritzsche in the Nazi State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second, a discussion of Fritzsche’s conspiratorial activities within
the Propaganda Ministry from 1933 through the attack on the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third, a discussion of Fritzsche’s connection, as a Nazi propagandist,
to the atrocities and the ruthless occupation policy which
formed a part of the Common Plan or Conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In listing Fritzsche’s positions, it is not intended at first to
describe the functions of these positions. Later on, in describing
some of Fritzsche’s conspiratorial acts, I shall take up a discussion
of some of these positions which he held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche’s Party membership and his various positions in the
propaganda apparatus of the Nazi State are shown by two affidavits
by Fritzsche himself: Document Number 2976-PS, which is already
in evidence as Exhibit USA-20; and Document Number 3469-PS,
which I offer in evidence as Exhibit USA-721. Both of these affidavits
have been put into the four working languages of this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche became a member of the Nazi Party on the 1st of May
1933, and he continued to be a member until the collapse in 1945.
Fritzsche began his services with the staff of the Reich Ministry
for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, hereinafter referred to as
the Propaganda Ministry, on the 1st of May 1933; and he remained
within the Propaganda Ministry until the Nazi downfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the Nazis seized political power in Germany and beginning
in September 1932, Fritzsche was head of the Wireless News Service
(Drahtloser Dienst), an agency of the Reich Government at that
time under the Defendant Von Papen. After the Wireless News
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
Service was incorporated into the Propaganda Ministry of Dr.
Goebbels in May 1933, Fritzsche continued as its head until the year
1938. Upon entering the Propaganda Ministry in May 1933, Fritzsche
also became head of the news section of the Press Division of the
Propaganda Ministry. He continued in this position until 1937. In
the summer of 1938, Fritzsche was appointed deputy to one Alfred
Ingemar Berndt, who was then head of the German Press Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Press Division, in the Indictment, is called the Home
Press Division. Since “German Press Division” seems to be a more
literal translation, we have called it the German Press Division
throughout this presentation. It is sometimes otherwise known as the
Domestic Press Division. We shall show later that this division was
the major section of the Press Division of the Reich Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in December 1938 Fritzsche succeeded Berndt as the head
of the German Press Division. Between 1938 and November 1942
Fritzsche was promoted three times. He advanced in title from
Superior Government Counsel to Ministerial Counsel, then to
Ministerialdirigent, and finally to Ministerialdirektor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In November 1942 Fritzsche was relieved of his position as head
of the German Press Division by Dr. Goebbels and accepted from
Dr. Goebbels a newly created position in the Propaganda Ministry,
that of Plenipotentiary for the Political Organization of the Greater
German Radio. At the same time he also became head of the Radio
Division of the Propaganda Ministry. He held both these positions
in radio until the Nazi downfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two allegations of the Indictment concerning Fritzsche’s
positions for which we are unable to offer proof. These allegations
appear at Page 34 of the English translation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first unsupported allegation states that Fritzsche was “Editor-in-Chief
of the official German News Agency (Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro).”
The second unsupported allegation states that
Fritzsche was “head of the Radio Division of the Propaganda
Department of the Nazi Party.” Fritzsche denies having held either
of these positions, in his affidavit, and therefore these two allegations
must fall for want of proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before discussing the documentation of the case I wish, in
passing, to state my appreciation for the assistance of Mr. Norbert
Halpern, Mr. Alfred Booth, and Lieutenant Niebergall, who sits at
my right, for their assistance in research, analysis, and translation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will note the relative shortness of this document
book. It has been marked as Document Book MM. It contains only
32 pages, which have been numbered consecutively in red pencil
for your convenience. The shortness of the documentation on this
particular case is possible only because of a long affidavit made by
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
the Defendant Fritzsche, which was signed by him on the 7th of
January 1946.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems appropriate to comment on this significant document
before proceeding. It is before Your Honors as Document Number
3469-PS, beginning at document book Page 19. As I said, it has
been translated into the four working languages of this proceeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This affidavit contains materials which have been extracted from
interrogations of Fritzsche and many materials which Fritzsche
volunteered to give himself, upon request made by me, through his
Defense Counsel, Dr. Fritz. Some of the portions of the final affidavit
were originally typed or handwritten by the Defendant Fritzsche
himself during this Trial or during the holiday recess. All these
materials were finally incorporated into one single affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This affidavit contains Fritzsche’s account of the events which
led to his entering the Propaganda Ministry and his account of his
later connections with that Ministry. Before Fritzsche made some
of the statements in the affidavit concerning the role of propaganda
in relation to important foreign political events, he was shown
illustrative headlines and articles from the German press at that
time, so that he could refresh his recollection and make more
accurate statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is believed that the Tribunal will desire to consider many
portions of this affidavit independent of this presentation, along with
the proof on the conspirators’ use of propaganda as a principal
weapon in the conspiracy. Some of this proof, you will recall, was
submitted by Major Wallis in the first days of this Trial in connection
with Brief E, entitled “Propaganda, Censorship, and Supervision
of the Cultural Activities,” and the corresponding document
book, to which I call the Tribunal’s attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Fritzsche affidavit there are a number of statements which
I would say were in the nature of self-serving declarations. With
respect to these, the Prosecution requests only that the Tribunal
consider them in the light of the whole conspiracy and the indisputable
facts which appear throughout the Record. The Prosecution did
not feel, either as a matter of expediency or of fairness, that it
should request Fritzsche, through his defense lawyer, Dr. Fritz, to
remove some of these self-serving declarations at this time and
submit them later in connection with his defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since I shall refer to this affidavit at numerous times throughout
the presentation, perhaps the members of the Tribunal will wish to
place a special marker in their document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By referring to Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the affidavit, the Tribunal
will note that Fritzsche first became a successful journalist in the
service of the Hugenberg Press, the most important chain of newspaper
enterprises in pre-Nazi Germany. The Hugenberg concern
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
owned papers of its own, but primarily it was important because
it served newspapers which principally supported the so-called
“national” parties of the Reich, including the NSDAP.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Paragraph 5 of his affidavit Fritzsche relates that in September
1932, when the Defendant Von Papen was Reich Chancellor, he was
made head of the Wireless News Service, replacing someone who
was politically unbearable to the Papen regime. The Wireless News
Service, I might say, was a government agency for spreading news
by radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche began making radio broadcasts at about this time with
very great success, a success which Goebbels recognized and was
later to exploit very efficiently on behalf of these Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis seized power on the 30th of January 1933. From Paragraph
10 of the Fritzsche affidavit we find that that very evening, the
30th of January 1933, two emissaries from Goebbels visited
Fritzsche. One of them was Dressler-Andress, head of the Radio
Division of the NSDAP; the other was an assistant of Dressler-Andress
named Sadila-Mantau. These two emissaries notified
Fritzsche that although Goebbels was angry with Fritzsche for
writing a critical article concerning Hitler, still Goebbels recognized
Fritzsche’s public success on the radio since the previous fall.
They stated further that Goebbels desired to retain Fritzsche as
head of the Wireless News Service on certain conditions: (1) That
Fritzsche discharge all Jews; (2) that he discharge all other personnel
who would not join the NSDAP; and (3) that he employ with the
Wireless News Service the second Goebbels’ emissary, Sadila-Mantau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche refused all these conditions except the hiring of Sadila-Mantau.
This was one of the first ostensible compromises after the
seizure of power which Fritzsche made on his road to the Nazi camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche continued to make radio broadcasts during this period
in which he supported the National Socialist coalition government
then still existing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In early 1933 SA troops several times called at the Wireless
News Service and Fritzsche prevented them, with some difficulty,
from making news broadcasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1933 Goebbels called the young Fritzsche to him for a
personal audience. At Paragraph 9 of his affidavit, Document
Number 3469-PS, Fritzsche has volunteered the following concerning
his prior relationships with Dr. Goebbels:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I was acquainted with Dr. Goebbels since 1928. Apparently
he had taken a liking to me, besides the fact that in my press
activities I had always treated the National Socialists in a
friendly way until 1931.
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk116'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Already before 1933 Goebbels, who was the editor of <span class='it'>The
Attack</span> (<span class='it'>Der Angriff</span>), Nazi newspaper, had frequently made
flattering remarks about the form and content of my writings,
which I did as contributor of many ‘national’ newspapers and
periodicals, among which were also some of more reactionary
character.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the first Goebbels-Fritzsche discussion in early April 1933,
Goebbels informed Fritzsche of his decision to place the Wireless
News Service within the Propaganda Ministry as of 1 May 1933. He
suggested that Fritzsche make certain rearrangements in the
personnel which would remove Jews and other persons who did not
support the NSDAP. Fritzsche debated with Goebbels concerning
some of these steps. It must be said that during this period Fritzsche
made some effort to place Jews in other jobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a second conference with Goebbels, shortly thereafter,
Fritzsche informed Goebbels about the steps he had taken in
reorganizing the Wireless News Service. Goebbels thereupon informed
Fritzsche that he would like to have him reorganize and
modernize the entire news services of Germany within the control
of the Propaganda Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recalled by the Tribunal that on the 17th of March
1933, approximately two months before this time, the Propaganda
Ministry had been formed by decree, 1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I,
Page 104, our Document Number 2029-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche was intrigued by the Goebbels offer. He proceeded to
conclude the Goebbels-inspired reorganization of the Wireless News
Service; and on the 1st of May 1933, together with the remaining
members of his staff, he joined the Propaganda Ministry. On this
same day he joined the NSDAP and took the customary oath of
unconditional loyalty to the Führer. From this time on, whatever
reservations Fritzsche may have had, either then or later, to the
course of events under the Nazis, Fritzsche was completely within
the Nazi camp. For the next 13 years he assisted in creating and
in using the principal propaganda devices which the conspirators
employed with such telling effect in each of the principal phases of
this conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1933 until 1942 Fritzsche held one or more positions within
the German Press Division. For 4 years indeed he headed this
Division, during those crucial years 1938 to 1942. That covers the
period when the Nazis undertook actual military invasions of
neighboring countries. It is, therefore, believed appropriate to spell
out in some detail, before this Tribunal, the functions of this German
Press Division. These functions will show the important and unique
position of the German Press Division as an instrument of the Nazi
conspirators not only in dominating the minds and the psychology
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
of Germans through the German Press Division and through the
radio but also as an instrument of foreign policy and psychological
warfare against other nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The already broad jurisdiction of the Propaganda Ministry was
extended by a Hitler decree of the 30th of June 1933, found in 1933
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, Page 449. From that decree I wish to
quote only one sentence. It is found in Document 2030-PS, your
document book Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda
is competent for all problems concerning the mental moulding
of the nation, the propaganda for the State, for culture and
economy, and the enlightenment at home and abroad about
these questions. Furthermore, he is in charge of the administration
of all institutions serving these purposes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is important to underline the stated propaganda objective of
“enlightenment at home and abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a clear exposition of the general functions of the German
Press Division of the Propaganda Ministry, the Tribunal is referred
to Document Number 2434-PS, document book Page 5. It is offered
in evidence as Exhibit USA-722. This document is an appropriate
excerpt from a book by Georg Wilhelm Müller, a Ministerial
Director in the Propaganda Ministry, of which the Tribunal is asked
to take judicial notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche’s affidavit, Paragraphs 14, 15, and 16, beginning at
Page 22 of your document book, contains an exposition of the
functions of the German Press Division, a description which confirms
and adds to the exposition in Müller’s book. Concerning the German
Press Division, Fritzsche’s affidavit states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the whole period from 1933 to 1945 it was the task
of the German Press Division to supervise the entire domestic
press and to provide it with directives by which this division
became an efficient instrument in the hands of the German
State leadership. More than 2,300 German daily newspapers
were subject to control.</p>
<hr class='tbk117'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The aim of this supervision and control, in the first years
following 1933, was to change basically the conditions existing
in the press before the seizure of power. That meant the
coordination into the New Order of those newspapers and
periodicals which had been serving capitalistic individual
interests or party politics. While the administrative functions
wherever possible were exercised by the professional associations
and the Reich Press Chamber, the political direction
of the German press was entrusted to the German Press
Division.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk118'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The head of the German Press Division held daily press
conferences in the Ministry for the representatives of all
German newspapers. Thereby all instructions were given
to the representatives of the press. These instructions were
transmitted daily, almost without exception and mostly
by telephone from headquarters by Dr. Otto Dietrich,
Reich Press Chief, in a set text, the so-called ‘Daily
Parole of the Reich Press Chief.’ Before the formulation of
this text the head of the German Press Division submitted to
him, Dietrich, the foremost press wishes expressed by Dr.
Goebbels and by other ministries. This was the case especially
with the wishes of the Foreign Office about which Dr. Dietrich
always wanted to make decisions personally or through his
representatives at headquarters, Helmut Sündermann and
chief editor Lorenz.</p>
<hr class='tbk119'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The actual interpretation of the direction in detail was thus
left entirely to the individual work of the various editors.
Therefore, it is by no means true that the newspapers and
periodicals were a monopoly of the German Press Division or
that essays and leading articles had to be submitted by them
to the Ministry. Even in war times this happened in exceptional
cases only. The less important newspapers and periodicals
which were not represented at the daily press conferences
received their information in a different way—by providing
them either with ready-made articles and reports, or by
confidential printed instruction. The publications of all other
official agencies were directed and coordinated likewise by
the German Press Division.</p>
<hr class='tbk120'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To enable the periodicals to get acquainted with the daily
political problems of newspapers and to discuss these problems
in greater detail, the <span class='it'>Informationskorrespondenz</span> was issued
especially for periodicals. Later on it was taken over by the
Periodical Press Division. The German Press Division likewise
was in charge of pictorial reporting insofar as it directed the
employment of pictorial reporters at important events.</p>
<hr class='tbk121'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In this way, and conditioned upon the prevailing political
situation, the entire German press was, by the German Press
Division, made a permanent instrument of the Propaganda
Ministry. Thereby, the entire German Press was subordinate
to the political aims of the government. This was exemplified
by the timely limitation and the emphatic presentation of such
press polemics as appeared to be most useful, as shown for
instance in the following themes: The class struggle of the
system era; the Leadership Principle and the authoritarian
state; the party and interest politics of the system era; the
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
Jewish problem; the conspiracy of world-Jewry; the Bolshevistic
danger; the plutocratic democracy abroad; the race
problem generally; the church; the economic misery abroad;
the foreign policy; the living space (Lebensraum).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This description of Fritzsche establishes clearly and in his own
words that the German Press Division was the instrument for
subordinating the entire German press to the political aims of the
government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now pass to Fritzsche’s first activities on behalf of the conspirators
within the German Press Division. It is appropriate to
read again from his affidavit, Paragraph 17, your document book
Page 23. Fritzsche begins by describing a conference with Goebbels
in late April or early May 1933:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At this time Dr. Goebbels suggested to me, in my capacity
as the expert on news technique, the establishment and
direction of a section ‘News’ within the Press Division of his
Ministry, in order to thoroughly organize and modernize the
German news agencies. In carrying out the task assigned to
me by Dr. Goebbels my field covered the entire news service
for the German press and the radio in accordance with the
directions given by the Propaganda Ministry, excepting at first
the DNB”—German News Agency.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An obvious reason why the DNB was excepted from Fritzsche’s
field at this time is that the DNB did not come into existence until
the year 1934 as we shall later see. Later on, in Paragraph 17 of the
Fritzsche affidavit, the Tribunal will note the tremendous funds put
at the disposal of Fritzsche in building up the Nazi news services.
Altogether the German news agencies received a 10-fold increase
in their budget from the Reich, an increase from 400,000 to 4 million
marks. Fritzsche himself selected and employed the chief editor for
the Transocean News Agency and also for the Europa Press.
Fritzsche states that some of the “directions of the Propaganda
Ministry which I had to follow were,” and then skipping, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. increase
of German news copy abroad at any cost,” and then skipping
again, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. spreading of favorable news on the internal construction
and peaceful intentions of the National Socialist system.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the summer of 1934 the Defendant Funk, then Reich
Press Chief, achieved the fusion of the two most important domestic
news agencies, the Wolff Telegraph Agency and the Telegraph
Union, and thus formed the official German news agency, ordinarily
known as DNB. It has already been pointed out to the Tribunal
that the Indictment is in error in alleging that Fritzsche himself
was Editor-in-Chief of the DNB. Fritzsche held no position whatsoever
with the DNB at any time. However, as head of the news
section of the German Press Division, Fritzsche’s duties gave him
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
official jurisdiction over the DNB, which was the official domestic
news agency of the German Reich after 1934. In the last part of
Paragraph 17 of this affidavit, Fritzsche states that he coordinated
the work of the various foreign news agencies “at home and
within European and overseas foreign countries with one another
and in relationship to DNB.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Wireless News Service was headed by Fritzsche from 1932
to 1937. After January 1933, the Wireless News Service was the
official instrument of the Nazi Government in spreading news over
the radio. During the same time that Fritzsche headed the Wireless
News Service, he personally made radio broadcasts to the German
people. These broadcasts were naturally subject to the controls of
the Propaganda Ministry and reflected its purposes. The influence
of Fritzsche’s broadcasts upon the German people, during this period
of consolidation of control by the Nazi conspirators, is all the more
important since Fritzsche was concurrently head of the Wireless
News Services, which controlled for the government the spreading
of all news by radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is by now well known to the world that the Nazi conspirators
attempted to be, and often were, very adept in psychological
warfare. Before each major aggression, with some few exceptions
based on the strategy of expediency, they initiated a press campaign
calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German
people psychologically for the impending Nazi madness. They
used the press after their earlier conquests as a means for further
influencing foreign politics and in maneuvering for the next following
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time of the occupation of the Sudetenland on the 1st of
October 1938, Fritzsche had become deputy head of the entire German
Press Division. Fritzsche states that the role of German propaganda
before the Munich Agreement on the Sudetenland was
directed by his immediate chief, Berndt, then head of the German
Press Division. In Paragraph 27 of the Fritzsche affidavit, Page 26
of your document book, Fritzsche describes this propaganda which
was directed by Berndt. Speaking of Berndt, Fritzsche states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He exaggerated minor events very strongly, sometimes used
old episodes as new—and there even came complaints from
the Sudetenland itself that some of the news reported by the
German press was untrustworthy. As a matter of fact, after
the great foreign political success at Munich in September
1938, there arose a noticeable crisis in the confidence of the
German people in the trustworthiness of its press. This was
one reason for the recalling of Berndt, in December 1938
after the conclusion of the Sudeten action, and for my
appointment as head of the German Press Division. Beyond
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
this, Berndt, by his admittedly successful but still primitive
military-like orders to the German press, had lost the confidence
of the German editors.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, what happened at this time? Fritzsche was made head of
the German Press Division in place of Berndt. Between December
1938 and 1942, Fritzsche, as head of the German Press Division,
personally gave to the representatives of the principal German
newspapers the “daily parole of the Reich Press Chief.” During
this history-making period he was the principal conspirator directly
concerned with the manipulations of the press. The first important
foreign aggression after Fritzsche became head of the German Press
Division was the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia. In Paragraph
28 of the affidavit, your document book, Page 26, Fritzsche
gives his account of the propaganda action surrounding the incorporation
of Bohemia and Moravia as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The action for the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia,
which took place on 15 March 1939, while I was head of the
German Press Division, was not prepared for such a long
period as the Sudeten action. According to my memory it
was in February that I received the order from the Reich
Press Chief, Dr. Dietrich, and repeated requests by the envoy
Paul Schmidt of the Foreign Office, to draw the attention of
the press to the aspirations of Slovakia for independence and
to the continued anti-German coalition politics of the Prague
Government. I did this. The daily paroles of the Reich Press
Chief and the press conference minutes at that time show the
wording of the pertinent instructions. The following were
the typical headlines of leading newspapers and the conspicuous
leading articles of the German daily press at that
time: (1) The terrorizing of Germans within the Czech territory
by arrest, shooting at Germans by the state police,
destruction and damaging of German homes by Czech mobs;
(2) the concentration of Czech forces on the Sudeten frontier;
(3) the kidnapping, deportation, and persecution of Slovakian
minorities by the Czechs, (4) the Czechs must get out of Slovakia;
(5) secret meetings of Red functionaries in Prague.</p>
<hr class='tbk122'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Some few days before the visit of Hacha, I received the
instruction to publish in the press very conspicuously the
incoming news on the unrest in Czechoslovakia. Such information
I received only partly from the German News Agency
DNB but mostly from the Press Division of the Foreign Office
and some from big newspapers with their own news services.
Among the newspapers offering information was, above all,
the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> which, as I learned later on,
received its information from the SS Standartenführer
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
Gunter D’Alquen, who was at that time at Bratislava. I had
forbidden all news agencies and newspapers to issue news
on unrest in Czechoslovakia until I had seen it. I wanted to
avoid a repetition of the very annoying accompaniments of
the Sudeten action propaganda, and I did not want to suffer
a loss of prestige caused by untrue news. Thus, all news
checked by me was admittedly full of tendency but not
invented. Following the visit of Hacha in Berlin and after
the beginning of the invasion of the German Army, which
took place on 15 March 1939, the German press had enough
material for describing these events. Historically and politically
the event was justified with the indication that the
declaration of independence of Slovakia had required an
interference and that Hacha with his signature had avoided
a war and had reinstated a thousand-year-old union between
Bohemia and the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The propaganda campaign of the press preceding the invasion of
Poland on the 1st of September 1939—and thus the propaganda
action just preceding the precipitation of World War II—bears again
the handiwork of Fritzsche and his German Press Division. In
Paragraph 30 of Fritzsche’s affidavit, document book Page 27,
Fritzsche speaks of the conspirators’ treatment of this episode as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Very complicated and varying was the press and propagandists
treatment in the case of Poland. Under the influence
of the German-Polish Agreement, the German press was for
many years forbidden, on principle, to publish anything on
the situation of the German minority in Poland. This was
still the case when in the spring of 1939 the German press
was asked to become somewhat more active as to the problem
of Danzig. Also when the first Polish-English conversations
took place and the German press was advised to use a sharper
tone against Poland, the question of the German minority
still remained in the background. At first during the summer
this problem was picked up again and created immediately
a noticeable sharpening of the situation. Each larger German
newspaper had for some time quite an abundance of material
on complaints and grievances of the Germans in Poland without
the editors having had a chance to use this material. The
German papers, from the time of the minority discussions at
Geneva, still had correspondents or free collaborators in Katowice,
Bydgoszcz, Posen, Toruń, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. Their material now
came forth with a bound. Concerning this, the leading German
newspapers brought but in accordance with directions
given for the so-called daily paroles the following articles, in
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
conspicuous setting: (1) Cruelty and terror against racial Germans
and the extermination of racial Germans in Poland;
(2) Construction of field works by thousands of racial German
men and women in Poland; (3) Poland, land of servitude and
disorder; the desertion of Polish soldiers; the increased inflation
in Poland; (4) provocation of frontier clashes upon direction
of the Polish Government; the Polish aspirations for
conquest; (5) persecution of Czechs and Ukrainians by Poland.
The Polish press retorted hotly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The press campaign preceding the invasion of Yugoslavia followed
the conventional pattern. You will find the customary defamations,
the lies, the incitement and the threats, and the usual
attempt to divide and to weaken the victim. Paragraph 32 of the
Fritzsche affidavit, your document book Page 28, outlines this
propaganda action as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the period immediately preceding the invasion of
Yugoslavia, on the 6th of April 1941, the German press
emphasized by headlines and leading articles the following
boldly made up announcements: (1) The systematic persecution
of racial Germans in Yugoslavia including the burning
down of German villages by Serbian soldiers and the confining
of racial Germans in concentration camps, as well as
the physical mishandling of German-speaking persons; (2) the
arming of Serbian bandits by the Serbian Government; (3) the
indictment of Yugoslavia by the plutocrats against Germany;
(4) growing anti-Serbian feeling in Croatia; (5) the chaotic
situation of the economic and social conditions in Yugoslavia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since Germany had a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union
and because these conspirators wanted the advantage of surprise,
there was no special propaganda campaign immediately preceding
the attack on the U.S.S.R. Fritzsche in Paragraph 33 of his affidavit
discussed the propaganda line, however, for the justification of this
aggressive war to the German people:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the night from the 21st to the 22d of June 1941,
Ribbentrop called me in at about 5 o’clock in the morning
for a conference in the Foreign Office at which representatives
of the domestic and foreign press were present. Ribbentrop
informed us that the war against the Soviet Union would
start that same day and asked the German press to present
the war against the Soviet Union as a preventive war for
the defense of the fatherland, a war which was forced upon
us by the imminent danger of an attack of the Soviet Union
against Germany. The claim that this was a preventive
war was later repeated by the newspapers which received
their instructions from me during the usual daily parole of the
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
Reich Press Chief. I myself have also given this presentation
of the cause of the war in my regular broadcasts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche, throughout his affidavit, constantly refers to his technical
and expert assistance to the colossal apparatus of the Propaganda
Ministry. In 1939 he apparently became dissatisfied with the
efficiency of the existing facilities of the German Press Division
in furnishing grist for the propaganda mill and for its intrigues.
He established a new instrument for improving the effectiveness
of Nazi propaganda. In Paragraph 19 of his affidavit, Page 24 of
your document book, Fritzsche describes this new propaganda
instrument as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“About the summer of 1939 I established within the German
Press Division a section called ‘Speed Service.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then skipping and quoting again:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at the start it had the task of checking the correctness of
news from foreign countries. Later on, about the fall of 1939,
this section also worked on the compilation of material which
was put at the disposal of the entire German press: For
instance, dates from the British Colonial policy, political statements
of the British Prime Minister in former times, descriptions
of social distress in hostile countries, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. Almost
all German newspapers used such material as a basis for
their polemics, whereby close concentration in the fighting
front of the German press was gained. The title ‘Speed Service’
was chosen because materials for current comments were
supplied with particular speed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout this entire period preceding and including the
launching of aggressive war, Fritzsche made regular radio broadcasts
to the German people under the following titles: “Political
Newspaper Review,” “Political and Radio Show,” and later “Hans
Fritzsche Speaks.” His broadcasts naturally reflected the polemics
and the control of his Ministry and thus of the Common Plan or
Conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We of the Prosecution contend that Fritzsche, one of the most
eminent of Goebbels’ propaganda team, helped substantially to
bathe the world in the blood bath of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Tribunal’s consent I will now pass to proof bearing
on Fritzsche’s incitement of atrocities and his encouragement of a
ruthless occupation policy. The results of propaganda as a weapon
of the Nazi conspirators reach into every aspect of this conspiracy,
including the abnormal and inhuman conduct involved in the atrocities
and the ruthless exploitation of occupied countries. Most of
the ordinary members of the German nation would never have
participated in or tolerated the atrocities committed throughout
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
Europe if they had not been conditioned and goaded to barbarous
convictions and misconceptions by the constant grinding of the Nazi
propaganda machine. Indeed, the propagandists who lent themselves
to this evil mission of instigation and incitement are more
guilty than the credulous and callous minions who headed the
firing squads or operated the gas chambers, of which we have heard
so much in this proceeding. For the very credulity and callousness
of those minions was in large part due to the constant and evil
propaganda of Fritzsche and his official associates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to Jews, the Department of Propaganda within the
Propaganda Ministry had a special branch for the “Enlightenment
of the German people and of the world as to the Jewish question,
fighting with propagandistic weapons against enemies of the State
and hostile ideologies.” This quotation is taken from a book written
in 1940 by Ministerial Director Müller, entitled <span class='it'>The Propaganda
Ministry</span>. It is found in Document Number 2434(a)-PS, your document
book Page 10, offered in evidence as Exhibit USA-722. It is
another excerpt from Ministerial Director Müller’s book and I
merely ask that you take judicial notice of it for that one sentence
that I have read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche took a particularly active part in this “enlightenment”
concerning the Jewish question in his radio broadcasts. These
broadcasts literally teemed with provocative libels against Jews,
the only logical result of which was to inflame Germany to further
atrocities against the helpless Jews who came within its physical
power. Document Number 3064-PS contains a number of complete
broadcasts by Fritzsche which were monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation and translated by BBC officials. For the convenience
of the Tribunal, I have had those excerpts upon which the
Prosecution relies to show illustrative types of Fritzsche’s broadcasts
mimeographed and made into one document, which I offer in
evidence as Exhibit USA-723. Even the Defendant Streicher, the
master Jew-baiter of all time, could scarcely outdo Fritzsche in
some of his slanders against the Jews. All the excerpts in Document
Number 3064-PS are from speeches by Fritzsche given on the radio
between 1941 and 1945, which we have already proven was a period
of intensified anti-Jewish measures. With the permission of the
Tribunal, I would like to read some of these excerpts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 14 of our document book, Item 1, from a broadcast of
18 December 1941—it is found on Page 2122 of the translations from
BBC:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fate of Jewry in Europe has turned out to be as unpleasant
as the Führer predicted it would be in the event of
a European war. After the extension of the war instigated
by Jews, this fate may also spread to the New World, for it
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
can hardly be assumed that the nations of this New World
will pardon the Jews for the misery of which the nations of
the Old World did not absolve them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a radio broadcast of 18 March 1941, found at Page 2032

Here, too, we can only applaud Mr. Roosevelt. It is precisely
because there exists no race which can be the master of the
rest of mankind, that we Germans have taken the liberty to
break the domination of Jewry and of its capital in Germany,
of Jewry which believed it had inherited the crown
of secret world domination.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In passing, I would merely like to note that it seems to us that
that is not only applause for past acts concerning persecution of
Jews but an announcement that more is coming and an encouragement
of what was coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to read another excerpt from the 9th of October
1941 broadcast, translated at Page 2101 of the BBC translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We know very well that these German victories, unparalleled
in history, have not yet stopped the source of hatred
which for a long time has fed the warmongers and from
which this war originated. The international Jewish-Democratic-Bolshevistic
campaign of incitement against Germany
still finds cover in this or that fox’s lair or rat hole. We have
seen only too frequently how the defeats suffered by the warmongers
only doubled their senseless and impotent fury.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another broadcast of the 8th January 1944—Your Honors, I
have tried to pick out illustrative broadcasts from different periods
here:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is revealed clearly once more that not a new system of
government, not a young nationalism, and not a new and
well-applied socialism brought about this war. The guilty
ones are exclusively the Jews and the plutocrats. If discussion
on the post-war problems brings this to light so clearly,
we welcome it as a contribution for later discussions and also
as a contribution to the fight we are waging now, for we
refuse to believe that world history will entrust its future
development to those powers which have brought about this
war. This clique of Jews and plutocrats have invested their
money in armaments and they had to see to it that they
would get their interests and sinking funds; hence they
unleashed this war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning Jews, I had one last quotation from the year 1945.
It is from a broadcast of the 13th of January 1945, found on Pages
2258 and 2259 of the BBC translations:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If Jewry provided a link between such divergent elements
as plutocracy and Bolshevism and if Jewry was first able to
work successfully in the democratic countries in preparing
this war against Germany, it has by now placed itself unreservedly
on the side of Bolshevism which, with its entirely
mistaken slogans of racial freedom against racial hatred, has
created the very conditions the Jewish race requires in its
struggle for domination, over other races.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then skipping a few lines in that quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Not the last result of German resistance on all the fronts,
so unexpected to the enemy, is the fruition of a development
which began in the pre-war years, that is, the process of
subordinating British policy to far-reaching Jewish points of
view. This development started long before this when Jewish
emigrants from Germany commenced their warmongering
against us from British and American soil.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then skipping several sentences and going to the last sentence
on that page.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This whole attempt, aiming at the establishment of Jewish
world domination, was obviously made at a time when the
national-racial consciousness had been too far awakened to
promise such an aim success.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors, we suggest that that is an invitation to further
persecution of the Jews and, indeed, to their elimination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche also incited and encouraged ruthless measures against
the peoples of the U.S.S.R. In his regular broadcasts Fritzsche’s
incitements against the peoples of the U.S.S.R. were often linked
to, and were certainly as inflammatory as, his slanders against the
Jews. If these slanders were not so tragic in their relation to the
murder of millions of people, they would be comical, indeed ludicrous.
It is ironic that the propaganda libels against the peoples of
the U.S.S.R. concerning atrocities actually described some of the
many atrocities committed by the German invaders, as we now well
know. The following quotations are again taken from the BBC
intercepted broadcasts and their translations, beginning shortly after
the invasion of the U.S.S.R. in June 1941. The first one is taken
again from Page 16 of our document book. I will read only the last
half of Item 7, beginning with the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As can be sufficiently seen by letters reaching us from the
front, from P.K. reporters”—and may I interrupt my quotation
there to say that “P.K.” stands for “Propaganda Kompanie,”
propaganda companies which were attached to the
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
German Army wherever it went—“P.K. reporters and soldiers
on leave, in this struggle in the East not one political system
is pitted against another, not one philosophy is fighting
another, but culture, civilization, and human dignity have
stood up against the diabolical principle of a subhuman
world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then another quote in the next paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was only the Führer’s decision to strike in time that saved
our homeland from the fate of being overrun by those subhuman
creatures, and our men, women, and children from
the unspeakable horror of becoming their prey.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the next broadcast I want to quote from, 10th of July 1941,
in the first paragraph Fritzsche speaks of the inhuman deeds committed
in areas controlled by the Soviet Union, and he states that
one, upon seeing the evidence of those deeds committed, comes—and
here I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. finally to make the holy resolve to lend one’s assistance
in the final destruction of those who are capable of such
dastardly acts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then quoting again, the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Bolshevist agitators made no effort to deny that in
towns, thousands, and in the villages, hundreds of corpses of
men, women, and children have been found, who had been
either killed or tortured to death. In spite of this Bolshevik
agitators assert that this was not done by Soviet commissars
but by German soldiers. But we know our German soldiers.
No German women, fathers, or mothers require proofs that
their husbands or their sons cannot have committed such
atrocious acts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Evidence already in the Record, or shortly to be offered in this
case by our Soviet colleagues, will prove that representatives of
these Nazi conspirators did not hesitate to exterminate Soviet soldiers
and civilians by scientific mass methods. These inciting
remarks by Fritzsche made him an accomplice in these crimes
because his labeling of the Soviet peoples as members of a “subhuman
world” seeking to “exterminate” the German people and
similar desperate talk helped, by these propaganda diatribes, to
fashion the psychological atmosphere of utter and complete unreason
and the hatred which instigated and made possible these atrocities
in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although we cannot say that Fritzsche directed that 10,000 or
100,000 persons be exterminated, it is enough to pause on this question:
Without these incitements of Fritzsche, how much harder it
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
would have been for these conspirators to have effected the conditions
which made possible the extermination of millions of people
in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>CAPT. SPRECHER: Fritzsche encouraged, affirmed, and glorified
the policy of the Nazi conspirators in ruthlessly exploiting the occupied
countries. Again I read an excerpt from his radio broadcast of
the 9th of October 1941, found at Pages 2102 and 2103 of the BBC
translation. I would like to cut it down, but it is one of those long
German sentences that just cannot be broken down:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today we can only say: Blitzkrieg or not, this German
thunderstorm has cleansed the atmosphere of Europe. Certainly
it is quite true that the dangers threatening us were
eliminated one after the other with lightning speed but in
these lightning blows which shattered England’s allies on
the continent, we saw not a proof of the weakness, but a
proof of the strength and superiority of the Führer’s gift as
a statesman and military leader; a proof of the German
peoples’ might; we saw the proof that no opponent can rival
the courage, discipline, and readiness for sacrifice displayed
by the German soldier, and we are particularly grateful
for these lightning, incomparable victories, because—as the
Führer emphasized last Friday—they give us the possibility
of embarking on the organization of Europe and on the
lifting of the treasures”—I would like to repeat that—“lifting
of the treasures of this old continent, already now in the
middle of war, without its being necessary for millions and
millions of German soldiers to be on guard, fighting day and
night along this or that threatened frontier; and the possibilities
of this continent are so rich that they suffice to supply
all needs in peace or war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the exploitation of foreign countries, Fritzsche
states himself, at Paragraph 39 of his affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The utilization of the productive capacity of the occupied
countries for the strengthening of the German war potential,
I have openly and with praise pointed out, all the more so
as the competent authorities put at my disposal much material,
especially on the voluntary placement of manpower.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche was a credulous propagandist indeed if he gloriously
praised the exploitation policy of the German Reich, chiefly or
especially because the competent authorities gave him a sales talk
on the voluntary placement of manpower.
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now to Fritzsche as the high commander of the entire
German radio system. Fritzsche continued as the head of the German
Press Division until after the conspirators had begun the last
of their aggressions. In November 1942, Goebbels created a new
position, that of Plenipotentiary for the Political Organization of
the Greater German Radio, a position which Fritzsche was the first
and the last to hold. In Paragraph 36, Document Number 3469-PS,
the Fritzsche affidavit, Fritzsche narrates how the entire German
radio and television system was organized under his supervision.
That is at Page 29 of your document book. He states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My office practically represented the high command of German
radio.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As special Plenipotentiary for the Political Organization of the
Greater German Radio, Fritzsche issued orders to all the Reich
propaganda offices by teletype. These were used first in conforming
the entire radio apparatus of Germany to the desires of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goebbels customarily held an 11 o’clock conference with his
closest collaborators within the Propaganda Ministry. When both
Goebbels and his undersecretary, Dr. Naumann, were absent, Goebbels,
after 1943, entrusted Fritzsche with the holding of this 11 o’clock
press conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Document Number 3255-PS the Court will find Goebbels’
praise of Fritzsche’s broadcasts. This praise was given in Goebbels’
introduction to a book by Fritzsche called, <span class='it'>War to the War Mongers</span>.
I would like to offer the quotation in evidence as Exhibit Number
USA-724, from the <span class='it'>Rundfunk Archiv</span>, at Page 18 of Your Honors’
document book. This is Goebbels speaking:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Nobody knows better than I how much work is involved in
those broadcasts, how many times they were dictated within
the last minutes to find some minutes later a willing ear by
the whole nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>So we have it from Goebbels himself that the entire German nation
was prepared to lend willing ears to Fritzsche, after he had made
his reputation on the radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rumor passed that Fritzsche was “His Master’s Voice” (Die
Stimme seines Herrn). This is certainly borne out by Fritzsche’s
functions. When Fritzsche spoke on the radio it was indeed plain
to the German people that they were listening to the high command
of the conspirators in this field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche is not being presented by the Prosecution as the type
of conspirator who signed decrees or as the type of conspirator who
sat in the inner councils planning all of the over-all grand strategy
of these conspirators. The function of propaganda is, for the most
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
part, apart from the field of such planning. The function of a
propaganda agency is somewhat more analogous to an advertising
agency or public relations department, the job of which is to sell
the product and to win the market for the enterprise in question.
Here the enterprise, we submit, was the Nazi conspiracy. In a
conspiracy to commit fraud, the gifted salesman of the conspiratorial
group is quite as essential and quite as culpable as the master
planners, even though he may not have contributed substantially to
the formulation of all the basic strategy, but rather contributed
to the artful execution of this strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this case the Prosecution most emphatically contends that
propaganda was a weapon of tremendous importance to this conspiracy.
We further contend that the leading propagandists were
major accomplices in this conspiracy, and further, that Fritzsche
was a major propagandist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Fritzsche entered the Propaganda Ministry, the most
fabulous “lie factory” of all time, and thus attached himself to this
conspiracy, he did this with a more open mind than most of these
conspirators who had committed themselves at an earlier date,
before the seizure of power. He was in a particularly strategic
position to observe the frauds committed upon the German people
and upon the world by these conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will recall that in 1933, before Fritzsche took his
party oath of unconditional obedience and subservience to the
Führer and thus abdicated his moral responsibility to these conspirators,
he had observed at first-hand the operations of the storm
troopers and the Nazi race pattern in action. When, notwithstanding
this, Fritzsche undertook to bring the German news agencies
in their entirety within fascist control, he learned from the inside,
from Goebbels’ own lips, much of the cynical intrigue and many of
the bold lies against opposition groups within and without Germany.
He observed, for example, the opposition journalists, a profession
to which he had previously been attached, being forced out
of existence, crushed to the ground, either absorbed or eliminated.
He continued to support the conspiracy. He learned from day to
day the art of intrigue and quackery in the process of perverting
the German nation, and he grew in prestige and influence as he
practiced this art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will also recall that Fritzsche had said that his
predecessor Berndt fell from the leadership of the German Press
Division partly because he overplayed his hand by the successful
but blunt and overdone manipulation of the Sudetenland propaganda.
Fritzsche stepped into the gap which had been caused by
the loss of confidence of both the editors and the German people,
and Fritzsche did his job well.
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt Fritzsche was not as blunt as the man he succeeded;
but Fritzsche’s relative shrewdness and subtlety, his very ability to
be more assuring and “to find,” as Goebbels said, “the willing ears
of the whole nation,” these things made him the more useful
accomplice of these conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi Germany and its press went into the actual phase of war
operations with Fritzsche at the head of the particular propaganda
instrument controlling the German press and German news, whether
by the press or by radio. In 1942 when Fritzsche transferred from
the field of the press to the field of radio, he was not removed for
bungling but only because Goebbels then needed him most in the
field of radio. Fritzsche is not in the dock as a free journalist, but
as an efficient, controlled Nazi propagandist, a propagandist who
helped substantially to tighten the Nazi stranglehold over the German
people, a propagandist who made the excesses of these conspirators
more palatable to the consciences of the German people
themselves, a propagandist who cynically proclaimed the barbarous
racialism which is at the very heart of this conspiracy, a propagandist
who coldly goaded humble Germans to blind fury against people
they were told by him were subhuman and guilty of all the suffering
of Germany, suffering which indeed these Nazis themselves, had
invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, I wish to say only this. Without the propaganda
apparatus of the Nazi State it is clear that the world, including
Germany, would not have suffered the catastrophe of these years;
and it is because of Fritzsche’s able role on behalf of the Nazi
conspirators and their deceitful and barbarous practices in connection
with the conspiracy that he is called to account before this
International Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the
United Kingdom): May it please the Tribunal, it was intended that
the next presentation would be by Colonel Griffith-Jones in the
case of the Defendant Hess. I understand that the Tribunal has in
mind that it might be better if that were left for the moment; if so,
Major Harcourt Barrington is prepared to make the presentation
with regard to the Defendant Von Papen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. We understood that the Defendant
Hess’s counsel could not be present today, and therefore it was
better to go on with one of the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If your Lordship pleases, then
Major Harcourt Barrington will deal with the presentation against
the Defendant Von Papen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR J. HARCOURT BARRINGTON (Junior Counsel for the
United Kingdom): My Lord, I understand that the court interpreters
have not got the proper papers and document books up
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
here yet, but they can get them in a very few minutes. Would your
Lordship prefer that I should go on or wait until they have got
them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Go on then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: May it please the Tribunal, it is my
duty to present the case against the Defendant Von Papen. Before
I begin I would like to say that the documents in the document
books are arranged numerically and not in the order of presentation,
and that the English document books are paged in red chalk at
the bottom of the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does that mean that the French and the
Soviet are not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: My Lord, we did not prepare French
and Soviet document books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Major Barrington, the French members of
the Tribunal have no document books at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: My Lord, there should be a German
document book for the French member. I understand it is now
being fetched. Should I wait until it arrives?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you can go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: The Defendant Papen is charged primarily
with the guilt of conspiracy, and the proof of this charge
of conspiracy will emerge automatically from the proof of the four
allegations specified in Appendix A of the Indictment. These are
as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) He promoted the accession of the Nazi conspirators to power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) He participated in the consolidation of their control over
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) He promoted the preparations for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) He participated in the political planning and preparation of
the Nazi conspirators for wars of aggression, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Broadly speaking, the case against Von Papen covers the period
from the 1st of June 1932 to the conclusion of the Anschluss in
March 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far in this Trial, almost the only evidence specifically
implicating Von Papen has been evidence in regard to his activities
in Austria. This evidence need only be summarized now. But if
the case against Von Papen rested on Austria alone, the Prosecution
would be in the position of relying on a period during which the
essence of his task was studied plausibility and in which his whole
purpose was to clothe his operations with a cloak of sincerity and
innocent respectability. It is therefore desirable to put the evidence
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
already given in its true perspective by showing in addition the
active and prominent part he played for the Nazis before he went
to Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papen himself claims to have rejected many times Hitler’s
request that he should actually join the Nazi Party. Until 1938
this may indeed have been true, for he was shrewd enough to see
the advantage of maintaining, at least outwardly, his personal
independence. It will be my object to show that, despite his facade
of independence, Papen was an ardent member of this conspiracy
and, in spite of warnings and rebuffs, was unable to resist its
fascination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the submission of the Prosecution, the key to Von Papen’s
activities is that, although perhaps not a typical Nazi, he was an
unscrupulous political opportunist and ready to fall in with the
Nazis when it suited him. He was not unpracticed in duplicity and
viewed with an apparent indifference the contradictions and
betrayals which his duplicity inevitably involved. One of his chief
weapons was fraudulent assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before dealing with the specific charges, I will refer to Document
2902-PS, which is on Page 38 of the English document book,
and I put it in as Exhibit GB-233. This is Von Papen’s own signed
statement showing his appointments. It is not in chronological
order, but I will read the relevant parts as they come. I need not
read the whole of it. The Tribunal will note that this statement
is written by Dr. Kubuschok, Counsel for Von Papen, although it
is signed by Von Papen himself. Paragraph 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Papen many times rejected Hitler’s request to join the
NSDAP. Hitler simply sent him the Golden Party Badge.
In my opinion, legally speaking, he did not thereby become
a member of the Party.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Interposing there, My Lord, the fact that he was officially regarded
as having become a member in 1938 will be shown by a document
which I shall refer to later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going on to Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From 1933 to 1945 Von Papen was a member of the Reichstag.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Papen was Reich Chancellor from the 1st of June 1932
to the 17th of November 1932. He carried on the duties of
Reich Chancellor until his successor took office—until the 2d
of December 1932.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 30th of January 1933 Von Papen was appointed Vice
Chancellor. From the 30th of June 1934”—which was the
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
date of the Blood Purge—“he ceased to exercise official duties.
On that day he was placed under arrest. Immediately after
his release on the 3rd of July 1934 he went to the Reich Chancellery
to hand in his resignation to Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of that paragraph I need not read. It is an argument
which concerns the authenticity or otherwise of his signature as it
appears in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> to certain decrees in August 1934.
I am prepared to agree with his contention that his signature on
those decrees may not have been correct and may have been a
mistake. He admits holding office only to the 3rd of July 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, as the Tribunal will also remember, in virtue of being
Reich Chancellor, a member of the Reich Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going on to Paragraph 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 13th of November 1933, Von Papen became Plenipotentiary
for the Saar. This office was terminated under
the same circumstances described under Paragraph 4.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the document I need not read. It concerns his
appointments to Vienna and Ankara, which are matters of history.
He was appointed Minister to Vienna on the 26th of July 1934,
and recalled on the 4th of February 1938, and he was Ambassador
in Ankara from April 1939 until August 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first allegation against the Defendant Von Papen is that he
used his personal influence to promote the accession of the Nazi
conspirators to power. From the outset Von Papen was well aware
of the Nazi program and Nazi methods. There can be no question
of his having encouraged the Nazis through ignorance of these
facts. The official NSDAP program was open and notorious; it had
been published in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> for many years; it had been
published and republished in the <span class='it'>Yearbook of the NSDAP</span> and
elsewhere. The Nazis made no secret of their intention to make it
a fundamental law of the State. This has been dealt with in full
at an earlier stage of the Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During 1932 Von Papen as Reich Chancellor was in a particularly
good position to understand the Nazi purpose and methods;
and in fact, he publicly acknowledged the Nazi menace. Take, for
instance, his Münster speech on the 28th of August 1932. This is
Document 3314-PS, on Page 49 of the English document book, and
I now put it in as Exhibit GB-234, and I quote two extracts at the
top of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The licentiousness emanating from the appeal of the leader
of the National Socialist movement does not comply very
well with his claims to governmental power.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not
concede him the right to regard only the minority following
his banner as the German nation and to treat all other fellow
countrymen as free game.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Take also his Munich speech of the 13th of October 1932. That
is on Page 50 of the English document book, Document Number
3317-PS, which I now put in as Exhibit GB-235, and I will simply
read the last extract on the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the interest of the entire nation, we decline the claim to
power by parties which want to bind their followers body
and soul and which want to identify their party or movement
with the German nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I do not rely on these random extracts to show anything more
than that he had, in 1932, clearly addressed his mind to the inherent
lawlessness of the Nazi philosophy. Nevertheless, in his letter to
Hitler of the 13 of November 1932, which I shall quote more fully
later, he wrote of the Nazi movement as, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so great a national movement, the merits of which for
people and country I have always recognized in spite of
necessary criticisms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So variable and so seemingly contradictory were Von Papen’s
acts and utterances regarding the Nazis that it is not possible to
present the picture of Papen’s part in this infamous enterprise
unless one first reviews the steps by which he entered upon it. It
then becomes clear that he threw himself, if not wholeheartedly,
yet with cool and deliberate calculation, into the Nazi conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall enumerate some of the principal steps by which Papen
fell in with the Nazi conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of his first personal contact with Hitler, Von Papen
as Chancellor rescinded, on the 14th of June 1932, the decree passed
on the 13th of April 1932 for the dissolution of the Nazi para-military
organizations, the SA and the SS. He thereby rendered
the greatest possible service to the Nazi Party, inasmuch as it relied
upon its para-military organizations to beat the German people
into submission. The decree rescinding the dissolution of the SA
and the SS is shown in Document D-631, on Page 64 of the document
book; and I now put it in as Exhibit GB-236. It is an extract
from the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, which was an omnibus decree. The
relevant passage is in Paragraph 20:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This order comes into operation from the day of announcement.
It takes the place of the Decree of the Reich President
for the Safeguarding of the State Authority of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—the date
should be the 13th of April 1932.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which page of the document book is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: I am sorry, My Lord; it is Page 64.
And the date shown there should not be the 3rd of May 1932, it
should be the 13th of April 1932. That was the decree which had
previously dissolved the Nazi para-military organizations under the
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
Government of Chancellor Brüning. At the bottom of the page the
Tribunal will see the relevant parts of the decree of the 13th of
April reproduced. At the beginning of Paragraph 1 of that decree
it said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All organizations of a military nature of the German National
Socialist Labor Party will be dissolved with immediate
effect, particularly the SA and the SS.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This rescission by Von Papen was done in pursuance of a bargain
made with Hitler which is mentioned in a book called <span class='it'>Dates from
the History of the NSDAP</span> by Dr. Hans Volz, a book published with
the authority of the NSDAP. It is already an exhibit, Exhibit
USA-592. The extract I want to quote is on Page 59 of the document
book, and it is Document Number 3463-PS. I quote an extract
from Page 41 of this little book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“28th of May”—that was in 1932, of course—“In view of the
imminent fall of Brüning, at a meeting between the former
Deputy of the Prussian Center Party, Franz Von Papen, and
the Führer in Berlin (first personal contact in spring 1932);
the Führer agrees that a Papen cabinet should be tolerated by
the NSDAP, provided that the prohibitions imposed on the
SA, uniforms, and demonstrations be lifted and the Reichstag
dissolved.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to imagine a less astute opening gambit for a man
who was about to become Chancellor than to reinstate this sinister
organization which had been suppressed by his predecessor. This
action emphasizes the characteristic duplicity and insincerity of his
public condemnations of the Nazis which I quoted a few minutes
ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eighteen months later he publicly boasted that at the time of
taking over the chancellorship he had advocated paving the way
to power for what he called the “young fighting liberation movement.”
That will be shown in Document 3375-PS, which I shall
introduce in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another important step was when, on the 20th of July 1932,
he accomplished his famous <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> in Prussia which removed
the Braun-Severing Prussian Government and united the ruling
power of the Reich and Prussia in his own hands as Reichskommissar
for Prussia. This is now a matter of history. It is
mentioned in Document D-632, which I now introduce as Exhibit
GB-237. It is on Page 65 of the document book. This document is,
I think, a semi-official biography in a series of public men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papen regarded this step, his <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> in Prussia, as a first
step in the policy later pursued by Hitler of coordinating the states
with the Reich, which will be shown in Document 3357-PS, which
I shall come to later.
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next step, if the Tribunal will look at Document D-632, on
Page 65 of the document book, the last four or five lines at the
bottom of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichstag elections of the 31st of July, which were the
result of Von Papen’s disbandment of the Reichstag on the
4th of June”—which was made in pursuance of the bargain
that I mentioned a few minutes ago—“strengthened enormously
the NSDAP, so that Von Papen offered to the leader
of the now strongest party his participation in the government
as Vice Chancellor. Adolf Hitler rejected this offer on
the 13th of August.</p>
<hr class='tbk123'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The new Reichstag, which assembled on the 30th of August,
was disbanded by the 12th of September. The new elections
brought about a considerable loss to the NSDAP, but did not
strengthen the Government parties, so that Papen’s Government
retired on the 17th of November 1932 after unsuccessful
negotiations with the Party leaders.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I shall wish to quote a few more extracts from that
biography, but as it is a mere catalogue of events, perhaps Your
Lordship would allow me to return to it at the appropriate time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as those negotiations mentioned just now in the biography
concern Hitler, they involved an exchange of letters in which
Von Papen wrote to Hitler on the 13th of November 1932. That
letter is Document D-633, on Page 68 of the English document book,
and I now put it in as Exhibit GB-238. I propose to read a part
of this letter, because it shows the positive efforts made by Papen
to ally himself with the Nazis, even in face of further rebuffs from
Hitler. I read the third paragraph. I should tell the Tribunal that
there is some underlining in the English translation of that paragraph
which does not occur in the German text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A new situation has arisen through the elections of November
the 6th, and at the same time a new opportunity for a
consolidation of all nationalist elements. The Reich President
has instructed me to find out by conversations with the
leaders of the individual parties concerned whether and how
far they are ready to support the carrying out of the political
and economic program on which the Reich Government has
embarked. Although the National Socialist press has been
writing that it is a naive attempt for Reich Chancellor
Von Papen to try to confer with personalities representing
the nationalist concentration, and that there can only be one
answer, ‘No negotiations with Papen,’ I would consider it
neglecting my duties, and I would be unable to justify it to
my own conscience, if I did not approach you in the spirit
of the order given to me. I am quite aware from the papers
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
that you are maintaining your demands to be entrusted with
the Chancellor’s Office, and I am equally aware of the continued
existence of the reasons for the decision of August the
13th. I need not assure you again that I myself do not claim
any personal consideration at all. All the same, I am of the
opinion that the leader of so great a national movement,
whose merits for people and country I have always recognized
in spite of necessary criticism, should not refuse to enter into
discussions on the situation and the decisions required with
the presently leading and responsible German statesman.
We must attempt to forget the bitterness of the elections and
to place the cause of the country which we are mutually
serving above all other considerations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler replied on 16 November 1932 in a long letter, laying
down terms which were evidently unacceptable to Von Papen,
since he resigned the next day and was succeeded by Von Schleicher.
That document is D-634, put in as part of Exhibit GB-238 as it
is part of the same correspondence. I need not read from the
letter itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the meetings between Papen and Hitler in January
1933, in the houses of Von Schröder and of Ribbentrop, culminating
in Von Schleicher being succeeded by Hitler as Reich Chancellor
on 30 January 1933. Referring back again to the biography on
Page 66 of the document book, there is an account of the meeting
at Schröder’s house, the second paragraph on the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The meeting with Hitler, which took place in the beginning
of January 1933, in the house of the banker Baron Von
Schröder in Cologne, is due to his initiative”—that means,
of course Papen’s initiative—“although Von Schröder was
the mediator. Both Von Papen and Hitler later made public
statements about this meeting (press of 6 January 1933).
After the rapid downfall of Von Schleicher on the 28th
of January 1933, the Hitler-Von Papen-Hugenberg-Seldte
Cabinet was formed on the 30th of January 1933 as a
government of national solidarity. In this cabinet Von Papen
held the office of Vice Chancellor and Reich Commissioner
for Prussia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The meetings at Ribbentrop’s house, at which Papen was also
present, have been mentioned by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe
(Document D-472, which was Exhibit GB-130).</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now wish to introduce into evidence an affidavit by
Von Schröder, but I understand that Dr. Kubuschok wishes to take
an objection to this. Perhaps before Dr. Kubuschok takes his
objection it might help if I said, quite openly, that Schröder is
now in custody, and according to my information he is at
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
Frankfurt; so that physically he undoubtedly could be called.
Perhaps I might also say at this moment that there would be no
objection from the Prosecution’s point of view to interrogatories
being administered to Von Schröder on the subject matter of this
affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EGON KUBUSCHOK (Counsel for Defendant Von Papen):
I object to the reading of the affidavit of Schröder. I know that
in individual cases the Tribunal has permitted the reading of
affidavits. This occurred under Article 19 of the Charter, which is
based on the proposition that the Trial should be conducted as
speedily as possible and that for this reason the Tribunal should
order the rules of ordinary court procedure in that respect. Of
decisive importance, therefore, is the speediness of the Trial. But
in our case the reading of the affidavit cannot be approved for
that reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our case is quite analogous to the case that was decided on
the 14th of December with regard to Kurt Von Schuschnigg’s
affidavit. Schröder is in the vicinity. Schröder was apparently
brought to the neighborhood of Nuremberg for the purposes of
this Trial. The affidavit was taken down on 5 December. He
could be brought here at any time. The reading of the affidavit
would have the consequence that I would have to refer not only
to him but also to several other witnesses, because Schröder
describes a series of facts in his affidavit which in their entirety
are not needed for the finding of a decision. However, once
introduced into the Trial, they must also be discussed by the
Defense in the pursuance of its duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affidavit discusses internal political matters, using improper
terms. For this reason misunderstandings would be brought into
the Trial which could be obviated by the hearing of a witness
I believe, therefore, that the oral testimony of a witness should
be the only way in which Schröder’s testimony should be submitted
to the Tribunal, since otherwise a large number of witnesses will
have to be called along with the reading of Schröder’s affidavit and
his personal interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you finished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to make any observation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: Yes, I do, My Lord. The Tribunal
has been asked to exclude this affidavit, using as a precedent the
decision on Von Schuschnigg’s affidavit. I think I am correct in
saying that Von Schuschnigg’s affidavit was excluded as an
exception to the general rule on affidavits which the Tribunal laid
down earlier the same day when Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit was
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
accepted. Perhaps Your Lordship will allow me to read from the
transcript the Tribunal’s decision on the affidavit of Messersmith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Messersmith was in Mexico, was he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: That is so, My Lord; yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: So that the difference between him and
Schuschnigg in that regard was very considerable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: In that regard, but what I was going
to say was this, My Lord: In ruling on Messersmith’s affidavit
Your Lordship said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of those provisions”—that is Article 19 of the
Charter—“the Tribunal holds that affidavits can be presented
and that in the present case it is a proper course. The
question of the probative value of the affidavit as compared
with the witness who has been cross-examined would, of
course, be considered by the Tribunal, and if at a later stage
the Tribunal thinks the presence of a witness is of extreme
importance, the matter can be reconsidered.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And Your Lordship added:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If the Defense wish to put interrogatories to the witness,
they will be at liberty to do so.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now in the afternoon of that day, when Schuschnigg’s
affidavit came up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which day was this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: This was the 28th of November, My
Lord. It is on Page 473 (Volume II, Page 352) of the transcript,
the Messersmith affidavit; and Page 523 (Volume II, Page 384) is
the Schuschnigg affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, when the objection was taken to the Schuschnigg affidavit,
the objection was put in these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today when the resolution was announced in respect of the
use to be made of the written affidavit of Mr. Messersmith,
the Court was of the opinion that in a case of very great
importance possibly it would take a different view of the
matter.”—And then defense counsel went on to say—“As it is
a case of such an important witness, the principle of direct
evidence must be adhered to.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you a reference to a subsequent
occasion on which we heard Mr. Justice Jackson upon this subject,
when Mr. Justice Jackson submitted to us that on the strict
interpretation of Article 19 we were bound to admit any evidence
which we deemed to have probative value?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: My Lord, I haven’t got that reference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why don’t you call this witness?
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: I say, quite frankly—and I was coming
on to that—this witness is in a position of being an alleged co-conspirator,
and I do not make any secret of the fact that for
obvious reasons the Prosecution would not desire to call him as a
witness, and I put this affidavit forward as an admission by a co-conspirator.
I admit that it is not an admission made in pursuance
of the conspiracy, but I submit that by technical rules of evidence,
this affidavit may be accepted in evidence as an admission by a
co-conspirator; and as I said before, there will be no objection to
administering interrogatories on the subject matter of this affidavit,
and indeed, the witness would be available to be called as a
defense witness if required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all I have to say on that, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There would be no objection to bringing
the witness here for the purpose of cross-examination upon the
affidavit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: I don’t think there could be any
objection if it were confined to the subject matter of the affidavit.
I would not like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How could you object, for instance, to the
defendant himself applying to call the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: As I said, I don’t think there could
be any objection to that, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The result would be the same, wouldn’t it?
If the witness were called for the purpose of cross-examination,
then he could be asked other questions which were not arising
out of the matter in the affidavit. If the defendant can call him
as his own witness, there can be no objection to the cross-examination
going outside the matter of the affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: Of course he couldn’t be cross-examined
by the Prosecution in that event, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean you would ask his questions in re-examination,
but they would not take the form of cross-examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: That is what I mean, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean that you would prefer that he
should be called for the defendants rather than be cross-examined
outside the subject matter of the affidavit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there anything you wish to add or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: There is nothing I wish to add.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is time for us to adjourn. We will
consider the matter.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARTIN HORN (Counsel for Defendant Von Ribbentrop):
In the place of Dr. Von Rohrscheidt, counsel for Defendant Hess,
I would like to make the following declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Von Rohrscheidt has been the victim of an accident. He
has broken his ankle. The Defendant Hess has asked me to notify
the Tribunal that from now on until the end of the Trial, he
desires to make use of his right under the Charter to defend
himself. The reason that he wants to do that for the whole length
of the Trial is to be found in the fact that due to his absence his
counsel will not be informed of the proceedings of the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will consider the oral
application which has just been made to it on behalf of the
Defendant Hess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the objection to the affidavit of Von Schröder which was
made this morning by counsel for the Defendant Von Papen, the
Tribunal does not propose to lay down any general rule about the
admission of affidavit evidence. But in the particular circumstances
of this case, the Tribunal will admit the affidavit in question but
will direct that if the affidavit is put in evidence, the man who
made the affidavit, Von Schröder, must be presented, brought here
immediately for cross-examination by the defendant’s counsel.
When I say immediately I mean as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: My Lord, I will not introduce this
affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Major Barrington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: My Lord, before coming on to that
affidavit, I last read a passage from the biography about the
meeting at Von Schröder’s house, and I ask the Tribunal to deduce
from that extract from the biography that it was at that meeting
that a discussion took place between Von Papen and Hitler, which
led up to the government of Hitler in which Von Papen served
as Vice Chancellor. So that now at the point the Defendant
Von Papen was completely committed to going along with the
Nazi Party, and with his eyes open and on his own initiative he
had helped materially to bring them into power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second allegation against the Defendant Von Papen is that
he participated in the consolidation of Nazi control over Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first critical year and a half of the Nazi consolidation
Von Papen, as Vice Chancellor, was second only to Hitler in the
Cabinet which carried out the Nazi program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The process of consolidating the Nazi control of Germany by
legislation has been fully dealt with earlier in this Trial. The high
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
position of Von Papen must have associated him closely with such
legislation. In July 1934 Hitler expressly thanked him for all that
he had done for the co-ordination of the government of the
National Revolution. That will appear in Document 2799-PS. In
fact, although I shall read from that document in a minute, the
document has been introduced to the Court by Mr. Alderman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two important decrees may be mentioned specially, as actually
bearing the signature of Von Papen. First, the decree relating to
the formation of special courts, dated the 21st of March 1933, for
the trial of all cases involving political matters. The Tribunal has
already taken judicial notice of this decree. The reference to the
transcript is Page 30 (Volume II, Page 197) of the 22d of November,
afternoon session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This decree was the first step in the Nazification of the German
judiciary. In all political cases it abolished fundamental rights,
including the right of appeal, which had previously characterized
the administration of German criminal justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same date, the 21st of March 1933, Von Papen personally
signed the amnesty decree liberating all persons who had
committed murder or any other crime between the 30th of January
and the 21st of March 1933 in the National Revolution of the
German people. That document is 2059-PS, and is on Page 30 of
the English document book. I read Section 1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think you need read the decrees if
you will summarize them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: If Your Lordship pleases, I will ask
you to take judicial notice of that decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: As a member of the Reich Cabinet,
Von Papen was, in my submission, responsible for the legislation
carried through even when the decrees did not actually bear his
signature. But I shall mention as examples two categories of
legislation in particular in order to show by reference to his own
previous and contemporaneous statements that they were not
matters of which he could say that as a respectable politician he
took no interest in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the civil service. As a public servant himself, Von Papen
must have had a hard but apparently successful struggle with his
conscience when associating himself with the sweeping series of
decrees for attaining Nazi control of the civil service. This has
been dealt with on Page 30 (Volume II, Page 197) of the transcript
of the 22d of November in the afternoon session, and Page 257
(Volume II, Page 207). In this connection I refer the Tribunal to
Document 351-PS, which is on Page 1 of the document book. It is
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
Exhibit USA-389, and it is the minutes of Hitler’s first Cabinet
meeting on the 30th of January 1933. I read from the last
paragraph of the minutes, on Page 5 of the document book in the
middle of the paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Deputy of the Reich Chancellor and the Reich
Commissioner for the State of Prussia suggested that the
Reich Chancellor should refute, in an interview at the
earliest opportunity, the rumors about inflation and the
rumors about infringing the rights of civil servants.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Even if this was not meant to suggest to Hitler the giving of a
fraudulent assurance, at the best it emphasizes the indifference
with which Von Papen later saw the civil servants betrayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, the decrees for the integration of the federal states
with the Reich. These again have been dealt with earlier in the
Trial, Page 29 (Volume II, Page 196) of the transcript of
22 November, afternoon session. The substantial effect of these
decrees was to abolish the states and to put an end to federalism
and any possible retarding influence which it might have upon the
centralization of power in the Reich Cabinet. The importance of
this step, as well as the role played by Papen, is reflected in the
exchange of letters between Hindenburg, Von Papen—in his
capacity as Reich Commissioner for Prussia—and Hitler, in
connection with the recall of the Reich Commissioner and the
appointment of Göring to the post of Prime Minister of Prussia.
I refer to Document 3357-PS, which is on Page 52 of the English
document book, and I now put it in as Exhibit GB-239.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In tendering his resignation on the 7th of April 1933,
Von Papen wrote to Hitler, and I read from the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“With the draft of the law for the co-ordination of the
states with the Reich, passed today by the Reich Chancellor,
legislative work has begun which will be of historical
significance for the political development of the German
State. The step taken on 20 July 1932 by the Reich
Government, which I headed at the time, with the aim of
abolishing the dualism between the Reich and Prussia is now
crowned by this new interlocking of the interests of the
state of Prussia with those of the Reich. You, Herr Reich
Chancellor, will now be, as once was Bismarck, in a position
to co-ordinate in all points the policy of the greatest of
German states with that of the Reich. Now that the new
law affords you the possibility of appointing a Prussian
Prime Minister, I beg you to inform the Reich President that
I dutifully return to his hands my post of Reich Commissioner
for Prussia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to read also the letter which Hitler wrote to
Hindenburg in transmitting this resignation. Hitler wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Vice Chancellor Von Papen has addressed a letter to me
which I enclose for your information. Herr Von Papen has
already informed me within the last few days that he has
come to an agreement with Minister Göring to resign on his
own volition, as soon as the unified conduct of the
governmental affairs in the Reich and in Prussia would be
assured by the new law on the co-ordination of policy in
the Reich and the States.</p>
<hr class='tbk124'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On the eve of the day when the new law on the institution
of Reichsstatthalter was adopted, Herr Von Papen considered
this aim as having been attained, and requested me to
undertake the appointment of the Prussian Prime Minister,
at the same time offering further collaboration in the Reich
Government, by now lending full service.</p>
<hr class='tbk125'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Herr Von Papen, in accepting the post of Commissioner
for the Government of Prussia in these difficult times since
30 January, has rendered a very meritorious service to the
realization of the idea of coordinating the policy in Reich
and states. His collaboration in the Reich Cabinet, to which
he is now lending all his energy, is infinitely valuable; my
relationship to him is such a heartily friendly one, that I
sincerely rejoice at the great help I shall thus receive.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was only 5 weeks before this that on the 3rd of March
1933, Von Papen had warned the electorate at Stuttgart against
abolishing federalism. I will now read from Document 3313-PS,
which is on Page 48 of the English document book, and which I
now introduce as Exhibit GB-240—about the middle of the third
paragraph. This is an extract from Von Papen’s speech at Stuttgart.
He said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Federalism will protect us from centralism, that organizational
form which focuses all the living strength of a nation
on one point. No nation is less fitted to be governed centrally
than the German.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Earlier, at the time of the elections in the autumn of 1932, Von
Papen as Chancellor had visited Munich. The <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span>
of the 12th of October 1932 commented on his policy. I refer to
Document 3318-PS on Page 51 of the English document book, which
I introduce as Exhibit GB-241. The <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span> commented:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Papen claimed that it had been his great aim from the
very beginning of his tenure in office to build a new Reich
for, and with, the various states. The Reich Government is
taking a definite federalist attitude. Its slogan is not a dreary
centralism or uniformity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>That was in October 1932. All that was now thrown overboard in
deference to his new master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the Jews. In March 1933 the entire Cabinet
approved a systematic state policy of persecution of the Jews. This
has already been described to the Tribunal. The reference to the
transcript is Pages 1442 (Volume III, Page 525) and 2490 (Volume V,
Page 93).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only 4 days before the boycott was timed to begin “with all
ferocity”—to borrow the words of Dr. Goebbels—Von Papen wrote
a radiogram of reassurance to the Board of Trade for German-American
Commerce in New York which had expressed its anxiety
to the German Government about the situation. His assurance—which
I now put in as Document D-635, and it will be Exhibit
GB-242 on Page 73 of the English document book—his assurance
was published in the <span class='it'>New York Times</span> on the 28th of March 1933,
and it contained the following sentence which I read from about the
middle of the page. This document is the last but one in the
German document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Reports circulated in America and received here with
indignation about alleged tortures of political prisoners and
mistreatment of Jews deserve strongest repudiation. Hundreds
of thousands of Jews, irrespective of nationality, who
have not taken part in political activities, are living here
entirely unmolested.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a characteristic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: The article in the <span class='it'>New York Times</span> goes back
to a telegram of the Defendant Von Papen, which is contained in
the document book one page ahead. The English translation has
a date of the 27th of March. This date is an error. The German text
which I received shows that it is a question of a weekend letter,
which, according to the figures on the German document, was sent
on the 25th of March. This difference in time is of particular
importance for the following reason:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In effect, on the 25th of March nothing was yet known concerning
the Jewish boycott, which Goebbels then announced for the
1st of April. The Defendant Von Papen could, therefore, on the
25th of March, point to these then comparatively few smaller
incidents as he does in the telegram. In any case, the conclusion
of the indictment that the contents of the telegram were a lie
thereby falls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Major Barrington, have you the original
of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: The original is here, My Lord; yes. It
is quite correct that there are some figures at the top, which, though
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
I had not recognized it, might indicate that it was dispatched on
the 25th.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And when was the meeting of the Cabinet
which approved the policy of persecution of the Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: Well, My Lord, I can’t say. It was some
time within the last few days of March, but it might have been on
the 26th. I can have that checked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: May I clarify that matter by saying that the
Cabinet meeting in which the Jewish question was discussed took
place at a much later date and that in this Cabinet meeting Cabinet
members, among others the Defendant Von Papen, condemned the
Jewish boycott. I shall submit the minutes of the meeting as soon
as my motion has been granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know what you mean by your motion
being granted. Does Counsel for the Prosecution say whether he
persists in his allegation or whether he withdraws it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: I will say this. Subject to checking the
date when the Cabinet meeting took place .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you can do that at the adjournment
and let us know in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: If Your Lordship pleases. At this point
I will just say this: That it was, as the Tribunal has already heard,
common knowledge at the time that the Nazi policy was anti-Jewish,
and Jews were already in concentration camps, so I will
leave it to the Tribunal to infer that at the time when that radiogram
was sent, which I am prepared to accept as being the 25th of
March, that Von Papen did know of this policy of boycotting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will go further now that I am on this point, and I will say
that Von Papen was indeed himself a supporter of the anti-Jewish
policy, and as evidence of this I will put in Document 2830-PS,
which is on Page 37A of the document book, and which I now
introduce as Exhibit GB-243.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a letter, My Lord, written by Von Papen from Vienna
on the 12th of May 1936 to Hitler on the subject of the Freiheitsbund.
Paragraph 4 of the English text is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The following incident is interesting. The Czech Legation
secretary Dohalsky has made to Mr. Staud, (leader of the
Freiheitsbund) the offer to make available to the Freiheitsbund
any desired amount from the Czech Government which
he would need for the strengthening of his struggle against
the Heimwehr. Sole condition is that the Freiheitsbund must
guarantee to adopt an anti-German attitude. Mr. Staud has
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
flatly refused this offer. This demonstrates how even in the
enemy’s camp the new grouping of forces is already taken
into account. From this the further necessity results for us
to support this movement financially as heretofore, and mostly
in reference to the continuation of its fight against Jewry.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: I must point out here a difficulty which has
apparently been caused by the translation. In the original German
text the word “mit Bezug” is used in regard to the transmittal in
the following way: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. referring to the continuation of its fight
against Jewry.” This word “mit Bezug” means here that under this
heading the money must be transmitted, although this was not the
real purpose, for the Austrian Freiheitsbund (Freedom Union) was
not an anti-Semitic movement but a legal trade union to which
Chancellor Dollfuss also belonged. This expression “mit Bezug”
means only that the transmittal of the money demanded a covering
designation because it was not permissible to transmit money from
abroad to a party recognized by the state for any party purposes,
as is shown by the rejected offer of the Czechoslovaks. I only
wanted to point out here that the words “in reference” perhaps give
a wrong impression and should rather be translated “referring.”
In any case, I should like to point out that this “in reference” was
a kind of camouflage for the transmittal of the money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know to which word you are referring,
but as I understand it the only purpose of referring to this letter
was to prove that in it Von Papen was suggesting that a certain
organization should be financially assisted in its fight against Jewry.
That is the only purpose of referring to the letter. I don’t know
what you mean about some word being wrongly translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: That is exactly how the error originated.
The money was not transmitted to fight Jewry for that was not at
all the purpose of this Christian Trade Union in Austria, but a
certain designation for the transmittal of the money had to be
devised. So this continuation of its fight against Jewry was used.
The purpose therefore was not the fight against Jewry but the
elimination through financial support of another foreign influence,
namely that of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I should have thought myself that the point
which might have been taken against the Prosecution was that the
letter was dated nearly 3 years after the time with which you were
then dealing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: That is so, My Lord; it was not at the
time of the previous one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, the previous one was marked 1933, and
this was 1936.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: Oh yes. I put it in, My Lord, only to
show what Von Papen’s position was by then, at any rate. If Your
Lordship has any doubt as to the translation I would suggest that
it might now be translated by the interpreter. We have the German
text, a photostat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you can have it translated again
tomorrow; if necessary, you can have it gone into again then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: Yes, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now to the Catholic Church. The Nazi treatment of the
Church has been fully dealt with by the United States Prosecution.
In this particular field Von Papen, a prominent lay Catholic, helped
to consolidate the Nazi position both at home and abroad as perhaps
no one else could have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In dealing with the persecution of the Church, Colonel Wheeler
read to the Tribunal Hitler’s assurance given to the Church on the
23rd of March 1933 in Hitler’s speech on the Enabling Act, an
assurance which resulted in the well-known Fulda Declaration of the
German bishops, also quoted by Colonel Wheeler. That was
Document 3387-PS, which was Exhibit USA-566. This deceitful
assurance of Hitler’s appears to have been made at the suggestion
of Von Papen 8 days earlier at the Reich Cabinet meeting at which
the Enabling Act was discussed, on the 15th of March 1933. I refer
to Document 2962-PS, which is Exhibit USA-578, and it is on Page 40
of the English document book. I read from Page 44, that is at the
bottom of Page 6 of the German text. The minutes say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Deputy of the Reich Chancellor and Reich Commissioner
for Prussia stated that it is of decisive importance to coordinate
into the new state the masses standing behind the
parties. The question of the incorporation of political Catholicism
into the new state is of particular importance.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was a statement made by Von Papen at the meeting at
which the Enabling Act was discussed prior to Hitler’s speech on the
Enabling Act in which he gave his assurance to the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 20th of July 1933 Papen signed the Reich Concordat
negotiated by him with the Vatican. The Tribunal has already
taken judicial notice of this as Document 3280(a)-PS. The signing
of the Concordat, like Hitler’s Papen-inspired speech on the Enabling
Act, was only an interlude in the church policy of the Nazi
conspirators. Their policy of assurances was followed by a long
series of violations which eventually resulted in Papal denunciation
in the Encyclical “Mit brennender Sorge,” which is 3476-PS,
Exhibit USA-567.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papen maintains that his actions regarding the Church were
sincere, and he has asserted during interrogations that it was Hitler
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
who sabotaged the Concordat. If Von Papen really believed in the
very solemn undertakings given by him on behalf of the Reich to
the Vatican, I submit it is strange that he, himself a Catholic,
should have continued to serve Hitler after all those violations and
even after the Papal Encyclical itself. I will go further. I will say
that Papen was himself involved in what was virtually, if not
technically, a violation of the Concordat. The Tribunal will recollect
the allocution of the Pope, dated the 2d of June 1945, which is
Document 3268-PS, Exhibit USA-356, from which on Page 1647
(Volume IV, Page 64) of the transcript Colonel Storey read the
Pope’s own summary of the Nazis’ bitter struggle against the
Church. The very first item the Pope mentioned is the dissolution
of Catholic organizations and if the Tribunal will look at Document
3376-PS on Page 56 of the English document book, which I now put
in as Exhibit GB-244 and which is an extract from <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>,
they will see that in September 1934 Von Papen ordered—and I say
“ordered” advisedly—the dissolution of the Union of Catholic Germans,
of which he was at the time the leader. The text of <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Directorate of the Party announced the self-dissolution
of the Union of Catholic Germans.</p>
<hr class='tbk126'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Since the Reich Directorate of the Party, through its Department
for Cultural Peace, administers directly and to an
increasing extent all cultural problems including those concerning
the relations of State and churches, the tasks at first
delegated to the Union of Catholic Germans are now included
in those of the Reich Directorate of the Party in the interest
of a still closer co-ordination.</p>
<hr class='tbk127'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Former Vice Chancellor Von Papen, up to now the leader of
the Union of Catholic Germans, declared about the dissolution
of this organization that it was done upon his suggestion,
since the attitude of the National Socialist State toward the
Christian and Catholic Church had been explained often and
unequivocally by the Führer and Chancellor himself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I said that Von Papen “ordered” the dissolutions, although the
announcement said it was self-dissolution on his suggestion; but I
submit that such a suggestion from one in Papen’s position was
equivalent to an order, since by that date it was common knowledge
that the Nazis were dropping all pretense that rival organizations
might be permitted to exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After 9 months’ service under Hitler, spent in consolidating the
Nazi control, Von Papen was evidently well content with his choice.
I refer to Document 3375-PS, Page 54 of the English document
book, which I put in as Exhibit GB-245. On the 2d of November
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
1933, speaking at Essen from the same platform as Hitler and Gauleiter
Terboven, in the course of the campaign for the Reichstag
election and the referendum concerning Germany’s leaving the
League of Nations, Von Papen declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ever since Providence called upon me to become the pioneer
of national resurrection and the rebirth of our homeland,
I have tried to support with all my strength the work of the
National Socialist movement and its Führer; and just as I at
the time of taking over the Chancellorship”—that was in
1932—“advocated paving the way to power for the young
fighting liberation movement, just as I on January 30 was
destined by a gracious fate to put the hands of our Chancellor
and Führer into the hand of our beloved Field Marshal, so
do I today again feel the obligation to say to the German
people and all those who have kept confidence in me:</p>
<hr class='tbk128'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The good Lord has blessed Germany by giving her in times
of deep distress a leader who will lead her through all
distresses and weaknesses, through all crises and moments of
danger, with the sure instinct of the statesman into a happy
future.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then the last sentence of the whole text on Page 55:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Let us, in this hour, say to the Führer of the new Germany
that we believe in him and his work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the Cabinet, of which Von Papen was a member
and to which he had given all his strength, had abolished the civil
liberties, had sanctioned political murder committed in aid of
Nazism’s seizure of power, had destroyed all rival political parties,
had enacted the basic laws for abolition of the political influence of
the federal states, had provided the legislative basis for purging the
civil service and judiciary of anti-Nazi elements, and had embarked
upon a State policy of persecution of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papen’s words are words of hollow mockery: “The good Lord
has blessed Germany .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third allegation against the Defendant Papen is that he
promoted preparations for war. Knowing as he did the basic program
of the Nazi Party, it is inconceivable that as Vice Chancellor
for a year and a half he could have been dissociated from the
conspirators’ warlike preparations; he, of whom Hitler wrote to
Hindenburg on the 10th of April 1933 that, “His collaboration in the
Reich Cabinet, to which he is now lending all his energy, is infinitely
valuable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth allegation against Papen is that he participated in the
political planning and preparations for wars of aggression and wars
in violation of international treaties. In Papen’s case this allegation
is really the story of the Anschluss. His part in that was a
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
preparation for wars of aggression in two senses: First, that the
Anschluss was the necessary preliminary step to all the subsequent
armed aggressions; second, that, even if it can be contended that the
Anschluss was in fact achieved without aggression, it was planned
in such a way that it would have been achieved by aggression if
that had been necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I need do no more than summarize Papen’s Austrian activities
since the whole story of the Anschluss has been described to the
Tribunal already, though with the Tribunal’s permission I would
like to read again two short passages of a particularly personal
nature regarding Papen. But before I deal with Papen’s activities
in Austria there is one matter that I feel I ought not to omit to
mention to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 18th of June 1934 Papen made his remarkable speech at
Marburg University. I do not propose to put it in evidence, nor is
it in the document book, because it is a matter of history and in
what I say I do not intend to commit myself in regard to the
motives and consequences of his speech which are not free from
mystery; but I will say this: That as far as concerns the subject
matter of Papen’s Marburg speech, it was an outspoken criticism of
the Nazis. One must imagine that the Nazis were furiously angry;
and although he escaped death in the Blood Purge 12 days later, he
was put under arrest for 3 days. Whether this arrest was originally
intended to end in execution or whether it was to protect him from
the purge as one too valuable to be lost, I do not now inquire.
After his release from arrest he not unnaturally resigned the Vice
Chancellorship. Now the question that arises—and this is why I
mention the matter at this point—is why, after these barbaric
events, did he ever go back into the service of the Nazis again?
What an opportunity missed! If he had stopped then he might have
saved the world much suffering. Suppose that Hitler’s own Vice
Chancellor, just released from arrest, had defied the Nazis and told
the world the truth. There might never have been a reoccupation
of the Rhineland; there might never have been a war. But I must
not speculate. The lamentable fact is that he slipped back, he
succumbed again to the fascination of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the murder of Chancellor Dollfuss only 3 weeks later, on
25 July 1934, the situation was such as to call for the removal of
the German Minister Rieth and for the prompt substitution of a
man who was an enthusiast for the Anschluss with Germany, who
could be tolerant of Nazi objectives and methods but who could
lend an aura of respectability to official German representation in
Vienna. This situation is described in the transcript at Pages 478
and 479 (Volume II, Pages 355, 356). Hitler’s reaction to the murder
of Dollfuss was immediate. He chose his man as soon as he heard
the news. The very next day, the 26th of July, he sent Von Papen
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
a letter of appointment. This is on Page 37 of the English document
book; it is document 2799-PS and it has already been judicially
noticed by the Tribunal. Mr. Alderman read the letter, and I only
wish to refer to the personal remarks toward the end. Hitler in this
letter, after reciting his version of the Dollfuss affair and expressing
his desire that Austrian-German relations should be brought again
into normal and friendly channels, says in the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For this reason I request you, dear Herr Von Papen, to take
over this important task just because you have possessed and
continue to possess my most complete and unlimited confidence
ever since our collaboration in the Cabinet.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And the last paragraph of the letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thanking you again today for all that you once have done
for the co-ordination of the Government of the National
Revolution and since then, together with us, for Germany .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This might be a good time to break off for
10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR BARRINGTON: My Lord, I had just read from the
letter of appointment as Minister in Vienna which Hitler sent to
Von Papen on the 26th of July 1934. This letter, which, of course,
was made public, naturally did not disclose the real intention of
Von Papen’s appointment. The actual mission of Von Papen was
frankly stated shortly after his arrival in Vienna in the course of
a private conversation he had with the American Minister, Mr.
Messersmith. I quote from Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit, which is
Document 1760-PS, Exhibit USA-57, and it is on Page 22 of the
document book, just about half way through the second paragraph.
Mr. Messersmith said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When I did call on Von Papen in the German Legation, he
greeted me with: ‘Now you are in my Legation and I can
control the conversation.’ In the baldest and most cynical
manner he then proceeded to tell me that all of southeastern
Europe, to the borders of Turkey, was Germany’s natural
hinterland and that he had been charged with the mission of
facilitating German economic and political control over all
this region for Germany. He blandly and directly said that
getting control of Austria was to be the first step. He definitely
stated that he was in Austria to undermine and weaken
the Austrian Government and from Vienna to work towards
the weakening of the governments in the other states to the
south and southeast. He said that he intended to use his
reputation as a good Catholic to gain influence with certain
Austrians, such as Cardinal Innitzer, towards that end.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the earlier period of his mission to Austria, Von
Papen’s activity was characterized by the assiduous avoidance of
any appearance of intervention. His true mission was re-affirmed
with clarity several months after its commencement when he was
instructed by Berlin that “during the next 2 years nothing can be
undertaken which will give Germany external political difficulties,”
and that every appearance of German intervention in Austrian
affairs must be avoided; and Von Papen himself stated to Berger-Waldenegg,
an Austrian Foreign Minister, “Yes, you have your
French and English friends now, and you can have your independence
a little longer.” All of that was told in detail by Mr. Alderman,
again quoting from Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit, which is in the
transcript at Pages 492 (Volume II, Page 354), 506, and 507 (Volume II,
Pages 362-364).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout this earlier period, the Nazi movement was gaining
strength in Austria without openly admitted German intervention;
and Germany needed more time to consolidate its diplomatic position.
These reasons for German policy were frankly expressed by the
German Foreign Minister Von Neurath in conversation with the
American Ambassador to France; this was read into the transcript
at Page 520 (Volume II, Page 381) by Mr. Alderman from Document
L-150, Exhibit USA-65.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Von Papen accordingly restricted his activities to
the normal ambassadorial function of cultivating all respectable
elements in Austria, and ingratiating himself in these circles. Despite
his facade of strict nonintervention, Von Papen remained in contact
with subversive elements in Austria. Thus in his report to Hitler,
dated 17 May 1935, he advised concerning Austrian-Nazi strategy as
proposed by Captain Leopold, leader of the illegal Austrian Nazis,
the object of which was to trick Dr. Schuschnigg into establishing
an Austrian coalition government with the Nazi Party. This is
Document 2247-PS, Exhibit USA-64, and it is in the transcript at
Pages 516 to 518 (Volume II, Pages 379, 380). It is on Page 34 of the
English document book. I don’t want to read this letter again, but
I would like to call the attention of the Tribunal to the first line of
what appears as the second paragraph in the English text, where
Von Papen, talking about this strategy of Captain Leopold, says,
“I suggest that we take an active part in this game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mention also in connection with the illegal organizations in
Austria, Document 812-PS, Exhibit USA-61, which the Tribunal
will remember was a report from Rainer to Bürckel, and which is
dealt with in the transcript at Pages 498 to 505 (Volume II,
Pages 367 to 376).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eventually the agreement of 11 July 1936 between Germany and
Austria was negotiated by Von Papen. This is already in evidence
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
as Document TC-22, Exhibit GB-20. The public form of this
agreement provides that while Austria in her policy should regard
herself as a German state, yet Germany would recognize the full
sovereignty of Austria and would not exercise direct or indirect
influence on the inner political order of Austria. More interesting
was the secret part of the agreement, revealed by Mr. Messersmith,
which ensured the Nazis an influence in the Austrian Cabinet and
participation in the political life of Austria. This has already been
read into the transcript at Page 522 (Volume II, Page 383) by
Mr. Alderman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the agreement the Defendant Von Papen continued to
pursue his policy by maintaining contact with the illegal Nazis, by
trying to influence appointments to strategic Cabinet positions, and
by attempting to secure official recognition of Nazi front organizations.
Reporting to Hitler on 1 September 1936, he summarized
his program for normalizing Austrian-German relations in pursuance
of the agreement of 11 July. This is Document 2246-PS,
Exhibit USA-67, on Page 33 of the English document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will recall that he recommended “as a guiding
principle, continued, patient, psychological manipulations with
slowly intensified pressure directed at changing the regime.” Then
he mentions his discussion with the illegal party and says that he is
aiming at “cooperative representation of the movement in the
Fatherland Front, but nevertheless is refraining from putting National
Socialists in important positions for the time being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no need to go over again the events that led up to the
meeting of Schuschnigg with Hitler in February 1938, which Von
Papen arranged and which he attended, and to the final invasion of
Austria in March 1938. It is enough if I quote from the biography
again on Page 66 of the document book. It is about two-thirds of
the way down the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Following the events of March 1938, which caused Austria’s
incorporation into the German Reich, Von Papen had the
satisfaction of being present at the Führer’s side when the
entry into Vienna took place, after the Führer, in recognition
of his valuable collaboration, had on 14 February 1938,
admitted him to the Party and had bestowed upon him the
Golden Party Badge.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And the biography continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At first Von Papen retired to his estate Wallerfangen in the
Saar district, but soon the Führer required his services again
and on the 18 April 1939 appointed Von Papen German
Ambassador in Ankara.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the fascination of serving Hitler triumphed once again, and
this time it was at a date when the seizure of Czechoslovakia could
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
have left no shadow of doubt in Papen’s mind that Hitler was
determined to pursue his program of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One further quotation from the biography on Page 66, the last
sentence of the last paragraph but one:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After his return to the Reich”—that was in 1944—“Von
Papen was awarded the Knight’s Cross of the War Merit
Order with Swords.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, I draw the Tribunal’s attention again to the
fulsome praises which Hitler publicly bestowed upon Von Papen for
his services, especially in the earlier days. I have given two instances
where Hitler said “His collaboration is infinitely valuable,”
and again “You possess my most complete and unlimited confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Papen, the ex-Chancellor, the soldier, the respected Catholic,
Papen the diplomat, Papen the man of breeding and culture—there
was the man who could overcome the hostility and antipathy of
those respectable elements who barred Hitler’s way. Papen was—to
repeat the words of Sir Hartley Shawcross in his opening speech—“one
of the men whose co-operation and support made the Nazi
Government of Germany possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That concludes my case. Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe will now
follow with the case of Von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: May it please the Tribunal, the
presentation against the Defendant Von Neurath falls into five
parts, and the first of these is concerned with the following positions
and honors which he held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a member of the Nazi Party from 30 January 1937 until
1945, and he was awarded the Golden Party Badge on 30 January
1937. He was general in the SS. He was personally appointed
Gruppenführer by Hitler in September 1937 and promoted to Obergruppenführer
on 21 June 1943. He was Reich Minister of Foreign
Affairs under the Chancellorship of the Defendant Von Papen from
2 June 1932 and under the Chancellorship of Hitler from 30 January
1933 until he was replaced by the Defendant Von Ribbentrop on
4 February 1938. He was Reich Minister from 4 February 1938 until
May 1945. He was President of the Secret Cabinet Council, to which
he was appointed on 4 February 1938, and he was a member of the
Reich Defense Council. He was appointed Reich Protector for
Bohemia and Moravia from 18 March 1939 until he was replaced by
the Defendant Frick on 25 August 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was awarded the Adler Order by Hitler at the time of his
appointment as Reich Protector. The Defendant Ribbentrop was the
only other German to receive this decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal please, these facts are collected in Document
2973-PS, which is Exhibit USA-19, and in that document, which is
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
signed by the defendant and his counsel, the defendant makes
comments on certain of these matters with which I should like to deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He says that the award of the Golden Party Badge was made on
30 January 1937 against his will and without his being asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I point out that this defendant not only refrained from
repudiating the allegedly unwanted honor, but after receiving it,
attended meetings at which wars of aggression were planned,
actively participated in the rape of Austria, and tyrannized Bohemia
and Moravia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second point is that his appointment as Gruppenführer was
also against his will and without his being asked. On that point,
the Prosecution submits that the wearing of the uniform, the receipt
of the further promotion to Obergruppenführer and the actions
against Bohemia and Moravia must be considered when the defendant’s
submission is examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then says that his appointment as Foreign Minister was by
Reich President Von Hindenburg. We submit we need not do more
than draw attention to the personalities of the Defendant Von Papen
and Hitler and to the fact that President Von Hindenburg died in
1934. This defendant continued as Foreign Minister until 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then says that he was an inactive Minister from the 4th of
February 1938 until May 1945. At that moment attention is drawn
to the activities which will be mentioned below and to the terrible
evidence as to Bohemia and Moravia which will be forthcoming
from our friend the Soviet prosecutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This defendant’s next point is that the Secret Cabinet Council
never sat nor conferred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I point out to the Tribunal that that was described as a select
committee of the Cabinet for the deliberation of foreign affairs; and
the Tribunal will find that description in Document 1774-PS, which
I now put in as Exhibit GB-246. This is an extract from a book by
a well-known author, and on Page 2 of the document book, the first
page of that document, in about the seventh line from the bottom
of the page, they will see that among the bureaus subordinated to
the Führer for direct counsel and assistance, number four is the
Secret Cabinet Council; President: Reich Minister Baron Von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if the Tribunal will be kind enough to turn over to Page 3,
about ten lines from the top, they will see the paragraph beginning:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A Secret Cabinet Council to advise the Führer in the basic
problems of foreign policy has been created by the decree
of 4 February 1938”—and a reference is given.</p>
<hr class='tbk129'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This Secret Cabinet Council is under the direction of Reich
Minister Von Neurath, and includes the Foreign Minister, the
Air Minister, the Deputy of the Führer, the Propaganda
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
Minister, the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, the Commanders-in-Chief
of the Army and Navy and the Chief of the
Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. The Secret Cabinet
council constitutes a closer staff of collaborators of the Führer
which consists exclusively of members of the Government
of the Reich; strictly speaking it represents a select committee
of the Reich Government for the deliberation on foreign
affairs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to have the formal composition of the body, that is
shown in Document 2031-PS, which is Exhibit GB-217. I believe that
has been put in. I need not read it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next point that the defendant makes as to his offices is that
he was not a member of the Reich Defense Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I may very shortly take that point by stages, I remind the
Tribunal that the Reich Defense Council was set up soon after
Hitler’s accession to power on 4 April 1933; and the Tribunal will
find a note of that point in Document 2261-PS, Exhibit USA-24; and
they will find that on the top of Page 12 of the document book there
is a reference to the date of the establishment of the Reich Defense
Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Defense Council is also dealt with in Document
2986-PS, Exhibit USA-409, which is the affidavit of the Defendant
Frick, which the Tribunal will find on Page 14. In the middle of that
short affidavit, Defendant Frick says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We were also members of the Reich Defense Council which
was supposed to plan preparations in case of war which later
on were published by the Ministerial Council for the Defense
of the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, that the membership of this Council included the Minister
for Foreign Affairs, who was then the Defendant Von Neurath, is
shown by Document EC-177, Exhibit USA-390. If the Tribunal will
turn to Page 16 of the document book, they will find that document
and, at the foot of the page, the composition of the Reich Defense
Council, the permanent members including the Minister for Foreign
Affairs. That document is dated “Berlin, 22 May 1933” which was
during this defendant’s tenure of that office. That is the first stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The functioning of this council, with a representative of this
defendant’s department, Von Bülow, present, is shown by the minutes
of the 12th meeting on 14 May 1936. That is Document EC-407,
which I put in as Exhibit GB-247. The Tribunal will find at Page
21 that the minutes are for the 14th of May 1936, and the actual
reference to an intervention of Von Bülow is in the middle of Page 22.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, the next period was after the secret law of 4 September
1938. This defendant was, under the terms of that law, a member
of the Reich Defense Council by virtue of his office as president of
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
the Secret Cabinet Council. That is shown by the Document 2194-PS,
Exhibit USA-36, which the Tribunal will find at Page 24, and if you
will look at Page 24, you will see that the actual copy which was
put in evidence was enclosed in a letter addressed to the Reich
Protector in Bohemia and Moravia on the 4th of September 1939.
It is rather curious that the Reich Protector for Bohemia and
Moravia is now denying his membership in the council when the
letter enclosing the law is addressed to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the Tribunal will be good enough to turn on to Page 28,
which is still that document, the last words on that page describe
the tasks of that council and say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of the Reich Defense Council consists, during
peacetime, in deciding all measures for the preparation of
Reich defense, and the gathering together of all forces and
means of the nation in compliance with the directions of the
Führer and Reich Chancellor. The tasks of the Reich Defense
Council in wartime will be especially determined by the
Führer and Reich Chancellor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal will turn to the next page, they will see that the
permanent members of the Council are listed, and that the seventh
one is the President of the Secret Cabinet Council, who was, again,
this defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit that that deals, for every relevant period, with this
defendant’s statement that he was not a member of the Reich
Defense Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second broad point that the Prosecution makes against this
defendant is that in assuming the position of Minister of Foreign
Affairs in Hitler’s Cabinet, this defendant assumed charge of a
foreign policy committed to breach of treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say first that the Nazi Party had repeatedly and for many
years made known its intention to overthrow Germany’s international
commitments, even at the risk of war. We refer to Sections
1 and 2 of the Party program, which, as the Tribunal has heard,
was published year after year. That is on Page 32 of the document
book. It is Document 1708-PS, Exhibit USA-255.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I just remind the Tribunal of these Points 1 and 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. We demand the unification of all Germans into Greater
Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of
peoples.</p>
<hr class='tbk130'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in
respect to other nations; abrogation of the peace treaties of
Versailles and St. Germain.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But probably clearer than that is the statement contained in
Hitler’s speech at Munich on the 15th of March 1939; and the Tribunal
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
will find one of the references to that on Page 40 at the middle of
the page. It begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to
abolish the Treaty of Versailles. It is absolutely nonsense for
the rest of the world to pretend today that I had not announced
this program until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of
listening to the foolish chatter of emigrees these gentlemen
should have read, merely once, what I have written, that is
written a thousand times.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is futile nonsense for foreigners to raise that point. It would
be still more futile for Hitler’s Foreign Minister to suggest that he
was ignorant of the aggressive designs of the policy. But I remind
the Tribunal that the acceptance of force as a means of solving
international problems and achieving the objectives of Hitler’s
foreign policy must have been known to anyone as closely in touch
with Hitler as the Defendant Von Neurath; and I remind the
Tribunal simply by reference to the passages from <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>,
which were quoted by my friend Major Elwyn Jones, especially
those toward the end of the book, Pages 552, 553, and 554.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that the Prosecution say that by the acceptance of this foreign
policy the Defendant Von Neurath assisted and promoted the
accession to power of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third broad point is that in his capacity as Minister of
Foreign Affairs this defendant directed the international aspects
of the first phase of the Nazi conspiracy, the consolidation of control
in preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I have already indicated, from his close connection with
Hitler this defendant must have known the cardinal points of
Hitler’s policy leading up to the outbreak of the World War, as
outlined in retrospect by Hitler in his speech to his military leaders
on the 23rd of November 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This policy had two facets: internally, the establishment of rigid
control; externally, the program to release Germany from its international
ties. The external program had four points: 1) Secession
from the Disarmament Conference; 2) the order to re-arm Germany;
3) the introduction of compulsory military services; and 4) the
remilitarization of the Rhineland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal will look at Page 35 in the document book, at
the end of the first paragraph they will find these points very briefly
set out, and perhaps I might just read that passage. It is Document
789-PS, Exhibit USA-23—about 10 lines before the break:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I had to reorganize everything, beginning with the mass of
the people and extending it to the Armed Forces. First,
reorganization of the interior, abolishment of appearances of
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
decay and defeatist ideas, education to heroism. While
reorganizing the interior, I undertook the second task: To
release Germany from its international ties. Two particular
characteristics are to be pointed out: Secession from the
League of Nations and denunciation of the Disarmament Conference.
It was a hard decision. The number of prophets
who predicted that it would lead to the occupation of the
Rhineland was large, the number of believers was very small.
I was supported by the nation, which stood firmly behind me,
when I carried out my intentions. After that the order for
rearmament. Here again there were numerous prophets who
predicted misfortunes, and only a few believers. In 1935 the
introduction of compulsory armed service. After that, militarization
of the Rhineland, again a process believed to be
impossible at that time. The number of people who put trust
in me was very small. Then, beginning of the fortification of
the whole country, especially in the west.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, these are summarized in four points. The Defendant Von
Neurath participated directly and personally in accomplishing each
of these four aspects of Hitler’s foreign policy, at the same time
officially proclaiming that these measures did not constitute steps
toward aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first is a matter of history. When Germany left the Disarmament
Conference this defendant sent telegrams dated the 14th of
October 1933, to the President of the conference—and that will be
found in <span class='it'>Dokumente Der Deutschen Politik</span>, on Page 94 of the first
volume for that year. Similarly this defendant made the announcement
of Germany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations on the
21st of October 1933. That again will be found in the official
documents. These are referred to in the transcript of the proceedings
of the Trial, and I remind the Tribunal of the complementary
documents of military preparation, which of course were read and
which are Documents C-140, Exhibit USA-51, the 25th of October
1933, and C-153, Exhibit USA-43, the 12th of May 1934. These have
already been read and I merely collect them for the memory and
assistance of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second point—the rearmament of Germany: When this
defendant was Foreign Minister, on the 9th of March 1935, the
German Government officially announced the establishment of the
German Air Force. That is Document TC-44, Exhibit GB-11, already
referred to. On the 21st of May 1935 Hitler announced a purported
unilateral repudiation of the Naval, Military, and Air clauses of
the Treaty of Versailles which, of course, involved a similar purported
unilateral repudiation of the same clauses of the Treaty for
the Restoration of Friendly Relations with the United States, and
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
that will be found in Document 2288-PS, Exhibit USA-38, which
again has already been read. On the same day the Reich Cabinet,
of which this defendant was a member, enacted the secret Reich
Defense Law creating the office of Plenipotentiary General for War
Economy, afterwards designated by the Wehrmacht armament
expert as “the cornerstone of German rearmament.” The reference
to the law is Document 2261-PS, Exhibit USA-24, a letter of Von
Blomberg dated the 24th of June 1935, enclosing this law, which is
already before the Tribunal; and the reference to the comment on
the importance of the law is Document 2353-PS, Exhibit USA-35.
Some of that has already been read, but if the Tribunal will be
good enough to turn to Page 52 where that appears, they will find
an extract and I might just give the Tribunal the last sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The new regulations were stipulated in the Reich Defense
Law of 21 May 1935, supposed to be promulgated only in case
of war but already declared valid for carrying out war preparations.
As this law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fixed the duties of the Armed Forces
and the other Reich authorities in case of war, it was also the
fundamental ruling for the development and activity of the
war economy organization.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The third point is the introduction of compulsory military service.
On the 16th of March 1935 this defendant signed the law for
the organization of the Armed Forces which provided for universal
military service and anticipated a vastly expanded German army.
This was described by the Defendant Keitel as the real start of the
large scale rearmament program which followed. I will give the
official reference in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, year 1935, Volume I,
Part 1, Page 369; and the references in the transcript are 411
(Volume II, Page 305), 454, and 455 (Volume II, Page 340).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth point was the remilitarization of the Rhineland. The
Rhineland was reoccupied on the 7th of March 1936. I remind the
Tribunal of the two complementary documents: 2289-PS, Exhibit
USA-56, the announcement of this action by Hitler; and C-139,
Exhibit USA-53, which is the “Operation Schulung,” giving the
military action which was to be given if necessary. Again the
reference to the transcript is Page 458 to Page 464 (Volume II,
Pages 342 to 347). These were the acts for which the defendant
shared responsibility because of his position and because of
the steps which he took; but a little later he summed up his
views on the actions detailed above in a speech before Germans
abroad made on the 29th of August 1937, of which I ask the Tribunal
to take judicial notice, as it appears in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>, 1937, at
Page 650. But I quote a short portion of it that appears on Page 72
of the document book:
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The unity of the racial and national will created through
Nazism with unprecedented elan has made possible a foreign
policy by which the fetters of the Versailles Treaty were
forced, the freedom to arm regained, and the sovereignty of
the whole nation re-established. We have really again become
master in our own house and we have created the means of
power to remain henceforth that way for all times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
world should have seen from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hitler’s deeds and words
that his aims are not aggressive.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The world, of course, had not the advantage of seeing these
various complementary documents of military preparation which
I have had the opportunity of putting before the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next section—and the next point against this defendant—is
that both as Minister of Foreign Affairs and as one of the inner
circle of the Führer’s advisers on foreign political matters, this
defendant participated in the political planning and preparation for
acts of aggression against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and other nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I might first put the defendant’s policy in a sentence, I would
say that it can be summarized as breaking one treaty only at a
time. He himself put it—if I may say so—slightly more pompously
but to the same effect in a speech before the Academy of German
Law on the 30th of October 1937, which appears in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>,
October 1937, Page 921, and which the Tribunal will find in the
document book on Page 73. The underlining (italics) is mine:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In recognition of these elementary facts the Reich Cabinet
has always interceded <span class='it'>in favor of treating every concrete
international problem within the scope of methods especially
suited to it; not to complicate it unnecessarily by involvement
with other problems; and, as long as problems between only
two powers are concerned, to choose the direct way for an
immediate understanding between these two powers. We are
in a position to state that this method has fully proved itself
good not only in the German interest, but also in the general
interest.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The only country whose interests are not mentioned are the
other parties to the various treaties that were dealt with in that
way; and the working out of that policy can readily be shown by
looking at the tabulated form of the actions of this defendant when
he was Foreign Minister or during the term of his immediate successor
when the defendant still was purported to have influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1935 the action was directed against the Western Powers.
That action was the rearmament of Germany. When that was going
on another country had to be reassured. At that time it was Austria,
with the support of Italy—which Austria still had up to 1935. And
so you get the fraudulent assurance, the essence of the technique,
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
in that case given by Hitler, on the 21st of May 1935. And that is
shown clearly to be false, by the documents which Mr. Alderman
put in—I give the general reference to the transcript on Pages 534
to 545 (Volume II, Pages 388 to 398). Then, in 1936, you still have
the action necessary against the Western Powers in the occupation
of the Rhineland. You still have a fraudulent assurance to Austria
in the treaty of the 11th of July of that year; and that is shown
to be fraudulent by the letters from the Defendant Von Papen,
Exhibits USA-64 (Document 2247-PS) and 67 (Document 2246-PS),
to one of which my friend Major Barrington has just referred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in 1937 and 1938 you move on a step and the action is
directed against Austria. We know what that action was. It was
absorption, planned, at any rate finally, at the meeting on the
5th of November 1937; and action taken on the 11th of March 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reassurance had to be given to the Western Powers, so you have
the assurance to Belgium on the 13th of October 1937, which was
dealt with by my friend Mr. Roberts. The Tribunal will find the
references in Pages 1100 to 1126 (Volume III, Pages 289 to 307) of
the transcript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We move forward a year and the object of the aggressive action
becomes Czechoslovakia. Or I should say we move forward 6 months
to a year. There you have the Sudetenland obtained in September;
the absorption of the whole of Bohemia and Moravia on the 15th of
March 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was necessary to reassure Poland; so an assurance to
Poland is given by Hitler on the 20th of February 1938, and repeated
up to the 26th of September 1938. The falsity of that assurance
was shown over and over again in Colonel Griffith-Jones’ speech on
Poland, which the Tribunal will find in the transcript at Pages 966
to 1060 (Volume II, Pages 195 to 261).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then finally, when they want the action as directed against
Poland in the next year for its conquest, assurance must be given
to Russia, and so a non-aggression pact is entered into on the
23rd of August 1939, as shown by Mr. Alderman, at Pages 1160 to
1216 (Volume III, Pages 328 to 366).</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to that tabular presentation, one might say, in the
Latin tag, <span class='it'>res ipsa oquitur</span>. But quite a frank statement from this
defendant with regard to the earlier part of that can be found in
the account of his conversation with the United States Ambassador,
Mr. Bullitt, on the 18th of May 1936, which is on Page 74 of the
document book, Document L-150, Exhibit USA-65; and if I might
read the first paragraph after the introduction which says that he
called on this defendant, Mr. Bullitt remarks:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German
Government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until ‘the
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
Rhineland had been digested.’ He explained that he meant
that, until the German fortifications had been constructed on
the French and Belgian frontiers, the German Government
would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage
an outbreak by the Nazis in Austria and would pursue a
quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia. ‘As soon as our
fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central
Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at
will, all those countries will begin to feel very differently
about their foreign policies and a new constellation will
develop,’ he said.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I remind the Tribunal, without citing it, of the conversation
referred to by my friend, Major Barrington, a short time ago,
between the Defendant Von Papen, as Ambassador, and Mr. Messersmith,
which is very much to the same effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I come to the actual aggression against Austria, and I
remind the Tribunal that this defendant was Foreign Minister:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, during the early Nazi plottings against Austria in 1934.
The Tribunal will find these in the transcript at Pages 475 to 489
(Volume II, Pages 352-364), and I remind them generally that that
was the murder of Chancellor Dollfuss and the ancillary acts which
were afterwards so strongly approved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, when the false assurance was given to Austria on the
21st of May 1935, and the fraudulent treaty made on the 11th of
July 1936. References to these are Document TC-26, which is
Exhibit GB-19, and Document TC-22, which is Exhibit GB-20. The
reference in the transcript is at Pages 544 and 545 (Volume II,
Page 383).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third, when the Defendant Von Papen was carrying on his
subterranean intrigues in the period from 1935 to 1937. I again give
the references so the Tribunal will have it in mind: Document
2247-PS, Exhibit USA-64, letter dated 17 May 1935; and Exhibit
USA-67, Document 2246-PS, 1 September 1936. The references in
the transcript are Pages 492 (Volume II, Pages 363, 364), 516-518
(Volume II, Pages 372-374), 526-545 (Volume II, Pages 378 to 391),
and 553-554 (Volume II, Pages 394, 395).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Defendant Von Neurath was present when Hitler declared,
at the Hossbach interview on the 5th of November 1937, that the
German question could only be solved by force and that his plans
were to conquer Austria and Czechoslovakia. That is Document
386-PS, Exhibit USA-25, which the Tribunal will find at Page 82.
If you will look at the sixth line of Page 82, after the heading,
you will see that one of the persons in attendance at this highly
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
confidential meeting was the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Freiherr von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without reading a document which the Tribunal have had
referred to them more than once, may I remind the Tribunal that
it is on Page 86 that the passage about the conquest of Austria
occurs, and if the Tribunal will look after “2:” and “3:” the next
sentence is:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the improvement of our military-political position, it
must be our first aim in every case of warlike entanglement
to conquer Czechoslovakia and Austria simultaneously, in
order to remove any threat from the flanks in case of a possible
advance westwards.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is developed on the succeeding page. The important point
is that this defendant was present at that meeting; and it is
impossible for him after that meeting to say that he was not
acting except with his eyes completely open and with complete
comprehension as to what was intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the next point. During the actual Anschluss he received
a note from the British Ambassador dated the 11th of March 1938.
That is Document 3045-PS, Exhibit USA-127. He sent the reply
contained in Document 3287-PS, Exhibit USA-128. If I might very
briefly remind the Tribunal of the reply, I think all that is necessary—and
of course the Tribunal have had this document referred
to them before—is at the top of Page 93. I wish to call attention
to two obvious untruths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Von Neurath states in the sixth line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is untrue that the Reich used forceful pressure to bring
about this development, especially the assertion, which was
spread later by the former Federal Chancellor, that the German
Government had presented the Federal President with
a conditional ultimatum. It is a pure invention.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>According to the ultimatum, he had to appoint a proposed candidate
as Chancellor to form a Cabinet conforming to the proposals
of the German Government. Otherwise the invasion of Austria by
German troops was held in prospect.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The truth of the matter is that the question of sending
military or police forces from the Reich was only brought
up when the newly formed Austrian Cabinet addressed a
telegram, already published by the press, to the German
Government, urgently asking for the dispatch of German
troops as soon as possible, in order to restore peace and order
and to avoid bloodshed. Faced with the imminent danger of
a bloody Civil war in Austria, the German Government then
decided to comply with the appeal addressed to it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, as I said, My Lord, these are the two most obvious untruths,
and all one can say is that it must have, at any rate, given
this defendant a certain macabre sort of humor to write that, when
the truth was, as the Tribunal know it from the report of Gauleiter
Rainer to Bürckel, which has been put in before the Tribunal
as Document 812-PS, Exhibit USA-61, and when they have heard,
as they have at length, the transcripts of the Defendant Göring’s
telephone conversation with Austria on that day, which is Document
2949-PS, Exhibit USA-76, and the entries of the Defendant
Jodl’s diary for the 11th, 13th, and 14th of February, which is
Document 1780-PS, Exhibit USA-72.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this abundance of proof of the untruthfulness of these statements
the Tribunal may probably think that the most clear and
obvious correction is in the transcription of the Defendant Göring’s
telephone conversations, which are so amply corroborated by the
other documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution submits that it is inconceivable that this defendant
who, according to the Defendant Jodl’s diary—may I ask the
Tribunal just to look at Page 116 of the document book, the entry
in the Defendant Jodl’s diary for the 10th of March, so that they
have this point quite clear? It is the third paragraph, and it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 1300 hours General Keitel informs Chief of Operational
Staff, Admiral Canaris. Ribbentrop is being detained in
London. Neurath takes over the Foreign Office.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I submit that it is inconceivable when this defendant had taken
over the Foreign Office, was dealing with the matter, and as I shall
show the Tribunal in a moment, co-operating with the Defendant
Göring to suit the susceptibilities of the Czechs, that he should have
been so ignorant of the truth of events and what really was happening
as to write that letter in honor and good faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His position can be shown equally clearly by the account which
is given of him in the affidavit of Mr. Messersmith, Document
2385-PS, Exhibit USA-68. If the Tribunal will look at Page 107
of the document book, I remind them of that entry which exactly
describes the action and style of activity of this defendant at this
crisis. Two-thirds of the way down the page the paragraph begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I should emphasize here in this statement that the men who
made these promises were not only the dyed-in-the-wool
Nazis, but more conservative Germans who already had
begun willingly to lend themselves to the Nazi program.</p>
<hr class='tbk131'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In an official dispatch to the Department of State from
Vienna, dated 10 October 1935, I wrote as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk132'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Europe will not get away from the myth that Neurath,
Papen, and Mackensen are not dangerous people, and that
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
they are “diplomats of the old school.” They are in fact servile
instruments of the regime, and just because the outside
world looks upon them as harmless they are able to work
more effectively. They are able to sow discord just because
they propagate the myth that they are not in sympathy with
the regime.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned, until 24 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>FORTY-SECOND DAY</span><br/> Thursday, 24 January 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL (Colonel Charles W. Mays): If it please Your Honor,
the Defendant Streicher and the Defendant Kaltenbrunner are
absent this morning due to illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: May it please the Tribunal,
before the Tribunal adjourned, I was dealing with the share of
the Defendant Neurath in the aggression against Austria. Before
I proceed to the next stage, I should like the Tribunal, if it be so
kind, to look at the original exhibit to which I am referred, Document
3287-PS, Exhibit USA-128, which is the letter from this
defendant to Sir Nevile Henderson, who was then the British
Ambassador. The only point in which I would be grateful is if the
Tribunal would note Page 92 of the document book. When I say
original, that is a certified copy certified by the British Foreign
Office, but the Tribunal will see that the heading is from the
President of the Secret Cabinet Council. That is the point that the
Tribunal will remember. The question was raised as to the
existence or activity of that body and the letterhead is from the
defendant in that capacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next stage in the Austrian aggression is that at the time
of the occupation of Austria, this defendant gave the assurance
to M. Mastny, the Ambassador of Czechoslovakia to Berlin, regarding
the continued independence of Czechoslovakia. That is one
document at Page 123, TC-27, which I have already put in as
Exhibit GB-21. It was to Lord Halifax, who was then Foreign
Secretary; and if I may read the second paragraph just to remind
the Tribunal of the circumstances in which it was written,
M. Masaryk says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have in consequence been instructed by my Government
to bring to the official knowledge of His Majesty’s Government
the following facts: Yesterday evening (the 11th of
March) Field Marshal Göring made two separate statements
to M. Mastny, the Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin, assuring
him that the developments in Austria will in no way have
any detrimental influence on the relations between the German
Reich and Czechoslovakia, and emphasizing the continued
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
earnest endeavor on the part of Germany to improve those
mutual relations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then there are the particulars of the way it was put to
Defendant Göring, which have been brought to the Tribunal’s
attention several times, and I shall not do it again. The 6th paragraph
begins: “M. Mastny was in a position to give him definite
and binding assurances on this subject”—that is, to give the Defendant
Göring on the Czech mobilization—and then it goes on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and today spoke with Baron Von Neurath, who, among
other things, assured him on behalf of Herr Hitler that
Germany still considers herself bound by the German-Czechoslovak
Arbitration Convention concluded at Locarno
in October 1925.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the fact that the Defendant Von Neurath had been
present at the meeting on the 5th of November, 4 months previously,
when he had heard Hitler’s views on Czechoslovakia—and that it
was only 6 months before that really negotiated treaty was
disregarded at once—that paragraph, in my submission, is an
excellent example on the technique of which this defendant was
the first professor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the aggression against Czechoslovakia. On 28 May
1938 Hitler held a conference of important leaders including Beck,
Von Brauchitsch, Raeder, Keitel, Göring, and Ribbentrop at which
Hitler affirmed that preparations should be made for military action
against Czechoslovakia by October; and it is believed, though not—I
say frankly—confirmed, that the Defendant Von Neurath attended.
The reference of that meeting is in the transcript of Pages 742 and
743 (Volume III, Page 42).</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, is there any evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No. Your Lordship will remember
the documents, a long series of them, and it does not state who
was present; therefore, I express that and put it with reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 4th of September 1938 the government of which
Von Neurath was a member enacted a new Secret Reich Defense
Law which defined various official responsibilities in clear anticipation
of war. This law provided, as did the previous Secret Reich
Defense Law, for a Reich Defense Council as a supreme policy board
for war preparations. The Tribunal will remember that I have
already referred them to Document 2194-PS, Exhibit USA-36,
showing these facts. Then there came the Munich Agreement of
29 September 1938, but in spite of that, on the 14th of March 1939
German troops marched into Czechoslovakia; and the proclamation
to the German people and the order to the Wehrmacht is Document
TC-50, Exhibit GB-7, which the Tribunal will find at
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
Page 124, which has already been referred to and I shall not read
it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 16th of March 1939 the German Government, of which
Von Neurath was still a member, promulgated the “Decree of the
Führer and Reich Chancellor on the Establishment of the Protectorate
‘Bohemia and Moravia.’ ” That date is the 16th of March.
That is at Page 126 of the document book, TC-51, Exhibit GB-8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I may leave that for the moment, I will come back to it in
dealing with the setting up of the Protectorate. I will come back
in a moment and read Article 5. But taking the events in the order
of time, the following week the Defendant Von Ribbentrop signed
a treaty with Slovakia, which is at Page 129 (Document 1439-PS,
Exhibit GB-135); and the Tribunal may remember Article 2 of that
treaty, which is:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the purpose of making effective the protection undertaken
by the German Reich, the German Armed Forces shall
have the right at all times to construct military installations
and to keep them garrisoned in the strength they deem
necessary in an area delimited on its western side by the
frontiers of the State of Slovakia, and on its eastern side by
a line formed by the eastern rims of the Lower Carpathians,
the White Carpathians, and the Javornik Mountains.</p>
<hr class='tbk133'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Government of Slovakia will take the necessary steps
to assure that the land required for these installations shall
be conveyed to the German Armed Forces. Furthermore, the
Government of Slovakia will agree to grant exemption from
custom duties for imports from the Reich for the maintenance
of the German troops and the supply of military
installations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will appreciate that the ultimate objective of
Hitler’s policy disclosed at the meeting at which this defendant
was present on the 5th of November 1937, that is the resumption
of the “Drang nach Osten” and the acquisition of Lebensraum in
the East, was obvious from the terms of this treaty as it has been
explicit in Hitler’s statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we come to the pith of this criminality. By accepting
and occupying the position of Reich Protector of Bohemia and
Moravia, the Defendant Von Neurath personally adhered to the
aggression against Czechoslovakia and the world. He further
actively participated in the conspiracy of world aggression and he
assumed a position of leadership in the execution of policies
involving violating the laws of war and the commission of crimes
against humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will appreciate that I am not going to trespass on
the ground covered by my colleagues and go into the crimes. I want
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
to show quite clearly to the Tribunal the basis for these crimes
which was laid by the legal position which this defendant assumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first point. The Defendant Von Neurath assumed the position
of Protector under a sweeping grant of powers. The act creating
the Protectorate provided—if the Tribunal would be good enough
to turn back on Page 126 in the document book (TC-51, Exhibit
GB-8) and look at Article V of the Act, it reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. As trustee of Reich interests, the Führer and Chancellor
of the Reich nominates a ‘Reich Protector in Bohemia and
Moravia’ with Prague as his seat of office.</p>
<hr class='tbk134'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. The Reich Protector, as representative of the Führer and
Chancellor of the Reich and as Commissioner of the Reich
Government, is charged with the duty of seeing to the observance
of the political principles laid down by the Führer and
Chancellor of the Reich.</p>
<hr class='tbk135'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. The members of the Government of the Protectorate shall
be confirmed by the Reich Protector. The confirmation may
be withdrawn.</p>
<hr class='tbk136'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. The Reich Protector is entitled to inform himself of all
measures taken by the Government of the Protectorate and
to give advice. He can object to measures calculated to harm
the Reich and, in case of danger in delay, issue ordinances
required for the common interest.</p>
<hr class='tbk137'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. The promulgation of laws, ordinances, and other legal
provisions and the execution of administrative measures and
legal judgments shall be deferred if the Reich Protector
enters an objection.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the very outset of the Protectorate the Defendant Von Neurath’s
supreme authority was implemented by a series of basic
decrees of which I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice. They
established the alleged legal foundation for the policy and program
which resulted, all aimed towards the systematic destruction of the
national integrity of the Czechs:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. By granting the “racial Germans” in Czechoslovakia a
supreme order of citizenship—and I give the official reference to
the Decree of the Führer and Reich Chancellor concerning the
Protectorate to which I just referred—and then;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. An act concerning the representation in the Reichstag of
Greater Germany by German nationals resident in the Protectorate,
13 April 1939;</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. An order concerning the acquisition of German citizenship
by former Czechoslovakian citizens of German stock, 20 April 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a series of decrees that granted “racial Germans”
in Czechoslovakia a preferred status at law and in the courts:
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1. An order concerning the Exercise of Criminal Jurisdiction
in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, 14 April 1939;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. An order concerning the Exercise of Jurisdiction in Civil
Proceedings, 14 April 1939;</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. An order concerning the Exercise of Military Jurisdiction,
on 8 May 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the orders also granted to the Protector broad powers to
change by decree the autonomous law of the Protectorate. That is
contained in the Ordinance on Legislation in the Protectorate,
7 June 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And finally the Protector was authorized to go with the Reich
Leader SS and the Chief of the German Police to take, if necessary,
such police measures which go beyond the limits usually valid for
police measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the form of the order itself the Tribunal, if it cares
to listen and to take judicial notice of this, in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
we have found inserted that one in the document book at Page 131,
which rather staggers the imagination to know what can be police
measures even beyond the limits usually valid for police measures
when one has seen police measures in Germany between 1933 and
1939. But if such increase was possible, and presumably it was
believed to be possible, then an increase was given by the Defendant
Von Neurath and used by him for coercion of the Czechs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The declared basic policy of the Protectorate was concentrated
upon the central objective of destroying the identity of the Czechs
as a nation and absorbing their territory into the Reich; and if the
Tribunal will be good enough to turn to Page 132, they will find
Document Number 862-PS, Exhibit USA-313, and I think that has
been read to the Tribunal. Still, the Tribunal might bear with me
so that I might indicate the nature of the document to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This memorandum is signed by Lieutenant General of Infantry
Friderici. It is headed “The Deputy General of the Armed Forces
with the Reich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia.” It is marked
“Top Secret,” dated 15 October 1940. That is practically a year
before this Defendant Von Neurath went on leave, as he puts it,
on 27 September 1941; and it is called the “Basic Political Principles
in the Protectorate,” and there are four copies. It also had
gone to the Defendant Keitel and the Defendant Jodl, and it begins:
“On 9 October of this year”—that is 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 9 October of this year the Office of the Reich Protector
held an official conference in which State Secretary
SS Gruppenführer K. H. Frank”—that is not the Defendant
Frank, it is the other K. H. Frank—“spoke about the
following:
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk138'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Since creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,
party agencies, industrial circles, as well as agencies of the
central authorities of Berlin have been considering the
solution of the Czech problem.</p>
<hr class='tbk139'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After careful deliberation, the Reich Protector expressed
his view about the various plans in a memorandum. In this,
three possibilities of solution were indicated:</p>
<hr class='tbk140'/>
<p class='noindent'>“a. German infiltration of Moravia and withdrawal of the
Czech part of the people to a remainder of Bohemia. This
solution is considered as unsatisfactory, because the Czech
problem, even if in a diminished form, will continue to exist.</p>
<hr class='tbk141'/>
<p class='noindent'>“b. Many arguments can be brought up against the most
radical solution, namely, the deportation of all Czechs. Therefore
the memorandum comes to the conclusion that it cannot
be carried out within a reasonable space of time.</p>
<hr class='tbk142'/>
<p class='noindent'>“c. Assimilation of the Czechs, that is, absorption of about
half of the Czech people by the Germans, to the extent that
it is of importance from a racial or other standpoint. This
will be brought about, among other things, also by increasing
the Arbeitseinsatz of the Czechs in the Reich territory, with
the exception of the Sudeten German border districts—in
other words, by dispersing the block of Czech people. The
other half of the Czech nationality must by all possible ways
be deprived of its power, eliminated, and shipped out of the
country. This applies particularly to the racially mongoloid
parts and to the major part of the intellectual class. The
latter can scarcely be converted ideologically and would
represent a burden by constantly making claims for the
leadership over the other Czech classes and thus interfering
with a rapid assimilation.</p>
<hr class='tbk143'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Elements which counteract the planned Germanization are
to be handled roughly and should be eliminated.</p>
<hr class='tbk144'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The above development naturally presupposes an increased
influx of Germans from the Reich territory into the
Protectorate.</p>
<hr class='tbk145'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After a report, the Führer has chosen solution c (assimilation)
as a directive for the solution of the Czech problem
and decided that, while keeping up the autonomy of the
Protectorate outwardly, Germanization will have to be carried
out uniformly by the Office of the Reich Protector for years
to come.</p>
<hr class='tbk146'/>
<p class='noindent'>“From the above no specific conclusions are drawn by the
Armed Forces. It is the way that has always been followed.
In this connection, I refer to my memorandum which was
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
sent to the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces, dated 12 July 1939, entitled ‘The Czech Problem.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And that is signed, as I said, by the Deputy Lieutenant General
of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That view of the Reich Protector was accepted and formed a
basis of his policy. The result was a program of consolidating
German control over Bohemia and Moravia by the systematic
oppression of the Czechs through the abolition of civil liberties and
the systematic undermining of the native political, economic, and
cultural structure by a regime of terror, which will be dealt with
by my Soviet Union colleagues. They will show clearly, I submit,
that the only protection given by this defendant was a protection
to the perpetrators of innumerable crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already drawn the attention of the Tribunal to the many
honors and rewards which this defendant received as his worth,
and it might well be said that Hitler showered more honors on
Von Neurath than on some of the leading Nazis who had been with
the Party since the very beginning. His appointment as President
of the newly created Secret Cabinet Council in 1938 was in itself
a new and singular distinction. On 22 September 1940 Hitler
awarded him the War Merit Cross 1st Class as Reich Protector for
Bohemia and Moravia. That is in the Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro,
22 September 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was also awarded the Golden Badge of the Party and was
promoted by Hitler, personally, from the rank of Gruppenführer
to Obergruppenführer in the SS on 21 June 1943. And I also inform
the Tribunal that he and Ribbentrop were the only two Germans
to be awarded the Adlerorden, a distinction normally reserved for
foreigners. On his seventieth birthday, 2 February 1943, it was
made the occasion for most of the German newspapers to praise
his many years of service to the Nazi regime. This service, as
submitted by the Prosecution, may be summed up in two ways:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1) He was an internal Fifth Columnist among the Conservative
political circles in Germany. They had been anti-Nazi but were
converted in part by seeing one of themselves, in the person of
this defendant, wholeheartedly with the Nazis;</p>

<p class='pindent'>2) His previous reputation as a diplomat made public opinion
abroad slow to believe that he would be a member of a cabinet
which did not stand by its words and assurances. It was most
important for Hitler that his own readiness to break every treaty
or commitment should be concealed as long as possible, and for
this purpose he found in the Defendant Von Neurath his handiest
tool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That concludes the presentation against the Defendant Von Neurath.
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In view of the motion which was made
yesterday by Counsel for the Defendant Hess, the Tribunal will
postpone the presentation of the individual case against Hess, and
will proceed with the presentation of the case by counsel for
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. CHARLES DUBOST (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic): When stating the charges which now weigh upon the
defendants, my British and American colleagues showed evidence
that these men conceived and executed a plan and plot for the
domination of Europe. They have shown you of what crimes against
peace these men became guilty by launching unjust wars. They
have shown you that, as leaders of Nazi Germany, they had all
premeditated unjust wars, and had participated in the conspiracy
against peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then my friends and colleagues of the French Delegation,
M. Herzog, M. Faure and M. Gerthoffer, submitted documents
establishing that the defendants, who all in various positions
counted among the leaders of Nazi Germany, are responsible for
the repeated violations of the laws and customs of war committed
by men of the Reich in the course of military operations. However,
it still remains for us to expose the atrocities of which men, women,
and children of the occupied countries of the west were victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We intend at this point to prove that the defendants, in their
capacity as leaders of Hitlerite Germany, systematically pursued a
policy of extermination, the cruelty of which increased from day to
day until the final defeat of Germany; that the defendants planned,
conceived, willed, and prescribed these atrocities as part of a
system which was to enable them to accomplish a political aim. It
is this political aim which closely binds all the facts we intend to
present to you. The crimes perpetrated against people and property,
as presented so far by my colleagues of the French Prosecution,
were in close connection with the war. They had the distinct
character of war crimes <span class='it'>stricto sensu</span>. Those which I shall present
to you surpass them both in meaning and extent. They form part
of the plans of a policy of domination, of expansion, beyond war
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is Hitler himself who gave the best definition of this policy
in one of his speeches in Munich on 16 May 1927. He was deceiving
his listeners about the danger that France, an agricultural country
of only 40 million inhabitants, might represent for Germany, which
was already a highly-industrialized country with a population of
nearly 70 million. That day Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“There is only one way for Germany to escape encirclement;
and it is the destruction of the state which, by the natural
order of things, will always be her mortal enemy: that is
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
France. When a nation is aware that its whole existence is
endangered by an enemy, it must aim at one thing only:
the annihilation of that enemy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the first months that followed their victory, the Germans
seemed to have abandoned their plan of annihilation; but this was
only a tactical pretense. They hoped to draw into their war against
England and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics the western
nations they had enslaved. By doses of treachery and violence,
they attempted to make these western nations take the road of
collaboration. The latter resisted; and the defendants then
abandoned their tactics and came back to their big scheme, the
annihilation of conquered peoples in order to secure in Europe the
space necessary for the 250 million Germans whom they hoped
to settle there in generations to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This destruction, this annihilation—I repeat the very words
used by Hitler in his speech—was undertaken under various
pretenses; the elimination of inferior, or negroid races; the extermination
of bolshevism; the destruction of Jewish-Masonic influences
hostile to the founding of the pseudo “New European Order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, this destruction, this elimination, conduced to the
assassination of the elite and vital forces opposed to the Nazis; it
also led to the reduction of the means of livelihood of the enslaved
nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of this was done, as I shall prove to you, in execution of a
deliberate plan, the existence of which is confirmed, among other
things, by the repetition and the immutability of the same facts in
all the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faced with this repetition and this immutability, it is no longer
possible to claim that only the one who performed the crime was
guilty. This repetition and this immutability prove that the same
criminal will united all the members of the German Government,
all the leaders of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is from this common will that the official policy of terrorism
and extermination, which directed the strokes of the executioners,
was born; and it is for having participated in the creation of this
common will that each of the defendants here present has been
placed in the ranks of major war criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall come back to this point when, having finished my presentation
of the facts, I shall have to qualify the crime, in accordance
with the legal tradition of my country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allow me to give you some indications as to how, with your
kind permission, I intend to make my presentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The facts I am to prove here are the results of many testimonies.
We could have called innumerable witnesses to this stand. Their
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
statements have been collected by the French Office for Inquiry into
War Crimes. It seemed to us that it would simplify and shorten the
procedure if we were to give you extracts only from the testimony
that we have received in writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'> With your authorization, therefore, I shall limit myself to reading
excerpts from the written testimonies collected in France by official
organizations qualified to investigate War Crimes. However, if in
the course of this presentation it appears necessary to call certain
witnesses, we shall proceed to do so but with constant care not to
slow down the sessions in any way and to bring them with all
speed to the only possible conclusion, the one our peoples expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole question of atrocities is dominated by the German
terrorist policy. Under this aspect it is not without precedent in the
Germanic practice of war. We all remember the execution of hostages
at Dinant during the war of 1914, the execution of hostages in the
citadel of Laon, or the hostages of Senlis. But Nazism perfected this
terrorist policy; for Nazism, terror is a means of subjugation. We
all remember the propaganda picture about the war in Poland,
shown in Oslo in particular on the eve of the invasion of Norway.
For Nazism, terror is a means of subjugating all enslaved people in
order to submit them to the aims of its policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first signs of this terrorist policy during the occupation are
fresh in the memory of all Frenchmen. Only a few months after
the signing of the armistice they saw red posters edged with black
appear on the walls of Paris, as well as in the smallest villages of
France, proclaiming the first execution of hostages. We know
mothers who were informed of the execution of their sons in this
way. These executions were carried out by the occupiers after
anti-German incidents. These incidents were the answer of the
French people to the official policy of collaboration. Resistance to
this policy stiffened, became organized, and with it the repressive
measures increased in intensity until 1944—the climax of German
terrorism in France and in the countries of the West. At that time
the Army and the SS Police no longer spoke of the execution of
hostages; they organized real reprisal expeditions during which
whole villages were set on fire, and thousands of civilians killed, or
arrested and deported. But before reaching this stage, the Germans
attempted to justify their criminal exactions in the eyes of a
susceptible public opinion. They promulgated, as we shall prove,
a real code of hostages, and pretended they were merely complying
with law every time they proceeded to carry out reprisal executions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taking of hostages, as you know, is prohibited by Article 50
of the Hague Convention. I shall read this text to you. It is to be
found in the Fourth Convention, Article 50:
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“No collective penalty, pecuniary or other, can be decreed
against populations for individual acts for which they cannot
be held jointly responsible.” (Document Number RF-265).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, supreme perfidy! The German General Staff, the German
Government, will endeavor to turn this regulation into a dead
letter and to set up as law the systematic violation of the Hague
Convention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall describe to you how the General Staff formed its pseudo-law
on hostages, a pseudo-law which in France found its final
expression in what Stülpnagel and the German administration
called the “hostages code.” I shall show you, in passing, which of
these defendants are the most guilty of this crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 15th of February 1940 in a secret report addressed to the
Defendant Göring, the OKW justifies the taking of hostages, as
proved by the excerpt from Document Number 1585-PS which I
propose to read to you. This document is dated Berlin, 15 February
1940. It bears the heading: “Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.
Secret. To the Reich Minister for Aviation and Supreme Commander
of the Air Force.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Arrest of Hostages.</p>
<hr class='tbk147'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to the opinion of the OKW, the arrest of hostages
is justified in all cases in which the security of the troops and
the carrying out of their orders demand it. In most cases it
will be necessary to have recourse to it in case of resistance
or an untrustworthy attitude on the part of the population of
an occupied territory, provided that the troops are in combat
or that a situation exists which renders other means of
restoring security insufficient .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk148'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In selecting hostages it must be borne in mind that their
arrest shall take place only if the refractory sections of the
population are anxious for the hostages to remain alive. The
hostages shall therefore be chosen from sections of the
population from which a hostile attitude may be expected.
The arrest of hostages shall be carried out among persons
whose fate, we may suppose, will influence the insurgents.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This document is filed by the French Delegation as Exhibit Number
RF-267.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To my knowledge, Göring never raised any objection to this
thesis. Here is one more paragraph from an order, Document
Number F-508 (Exhibit Number RF-268), from the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army in France, administrative section, signed
“Stroccius,” 12 September 1940. Three months after the beginning
of the occupation, the hostages are defined therein as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hostages are inhabitants of a country who guarantee with
their lives the impeccable attitude of the population. The
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
responsibility for their fate is thus placed in the hands of
their compatriots. Therefore, the population must be publicly
threatened that the hostages will be held responsible for
hostile acts of individuals. Only French citizens may be taken
as hostages. The hostages can be held responsible only for
actions committed after their arrest and after the public
proclamation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This ordinance cancels 5 directives prior to 12 September 1940.
This question was the subject of numerous texts, and two General
Staff ordinances, dated, as indicated at the head of the Document
Number F-510 (Exhibit Number RF-269), 2 November 1940 and
13 February 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If acts of violence are committed by the inhabitants of the
country against members of the occupation forces, if offices
and installations of the Armed Forces are damaged or
destroyed, or if any other attacks are directed against the
security of German units and service establishments, and if,
under the circumstances, the population of the place of the
crime or of the immediate neighborhood can be considered as
jointly responsible for those acts of sabotage, measures of
prevention and expiation may be ordered by which the civil
population is to be deterred in future from committing,
encouraging, or tolerating acts of that kind. The population
is to be treated as jointly responsible for individual acts of
sabotage, if by its attitude in general towards the German
Armed Forces, it has favored hostile or unfriendly acts of
individuals, or if by its passive resistance against the investigation
of previous acts of sabotage, it has encouraged
hostile elements to similar acts, or otherwise created a favorable
atmosphere for opposition to the German occupation. All
measures must be taken in a way that it is possible to carry
out. Threats that cannot be realized give the impression of
weakness.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I submit these two documents as Exhibit Number RF-268 and 269
(Documents Number F-508 and F-510).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until now we have not found any trace in these German texts
of an affirmation which might lead one to think that the taking of
hostages and their execution constitute a right for the occupying
power; but here is a German text which explicitly formulates this
idea. It is quoted in your book of documents as Document Number
F-507 (Exhibit Number RF-270), dated Brussels, 18 April 1944. It is
issued by the Chief Judge to the military Commander-in-Chief in
Belgium and the North of France; and it is addressed to the German
Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden. It reads in the margin: “Most
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
Secret. Subject: Execution of 8 terrorists in Lille on 22 December
1943. Reference: Your letter of 16 March 1944 Lille document.”
You will read in the middle of Paragraph 2 of the text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Moreover, I maintain my point of view that the legal
foundations for the measures taken by the Oberfeldkommandantur
of Lille, by virtue of the letter of my police group
of the 2d of March 1944, are, regardless of the opinion of the
Armistice Commission, sufficiently justified and further
explanations are superfluous. The Armistice Commission is
in a position to declare to the French, if it wishes to go into
the question in detail at all, that the executions have been
carried out in conformity with the general principles of the
law concerning hostages.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is, therefore, quite obviously a state doctrine which is involved.
Innocent people become forfeit. They answer with their lives for
the attitude of their fellow-citizens towards the German Army. If
an offense is committed of which they are completely ignorant, they
are the object of a collective penalty possibly entailing death. This
is the official German thesis imposed by the German High Command,
in spite of the protests of the German Armistice Commission in
Wiesbaden. I say: A thesis imposed by the German High Command,
and I will produce the evidence. Keitel, on the 16th of September
1941, signed a general order which has already been read and filed
by my American colleagues under Document Number 389-PS
(Exhibit Number RF-271) and which I shall begin to explain. This
order concerns all the occupied territories of the East and the
West, as established by the list of addresses which includes all the
military commanders of the countries then occupied by Germany:
France, Belgium, Norway, Holland, Denmark, eastern territories,
Ukraine, Serbia, Salonika, southern Greece, Crete. This order was
in effect for the duration of the war. We have a text of 1944 which
refers to it. This order of Keitel, Chief of the OKW, is dictated by
a violent spirit of anti-Communist repression. It aims at all kinds
of repression of the civilian population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This order, which concerns even the commanders whose troops
are stationed in the West, points out to them that in all cases in
which attacks are made against the German Army:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is necessary to establish that we are dealing with a mass
movement uniformly directed by Moscow to which may also
be imputed the seemingly unimportant sporadic incidents
which have occurred in regions which have hitherto remained
quiet.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Consequently Keitel orders, among other things, that 50 to
100 Communists are to be put to death for each German soldier
killed. This is a political conception which we constantly meet in
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
all manifestations of German terrorism. As far as Hitlerite propaganda
is concerned, all resistance to Germany is of Communist
inspiration, if not in essence Communist. The Germans thereby
hoped to eliminate from among the resistance the nationalists
whom they thought hostile to Communism. But the Nazis also
pursued another aim: They still hoped above all to divide France
and the other conquered countries of the West into two hostile
factions and to put one of these factions at their service under the
pretext of anti-Communism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break off
for 10 minutes?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Keitel confirmed this order concerning hostages on
24 September 1941. We submit it as Exhibit Number RF-272, and
you will find it in your document book as F-554. I shall read you
the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Following instructions by the Führer, the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces issued on 16 September 1941 an
order concerning the Communist revolutionary movements in
the occupied territories. The order was addressed to the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the attention of Ambassador
Ritter. It also deals with the question of capital punishment
in court-martial proceedings.</p>
<hr class='tbk149'/>
<p class='noindent'>“According to the order, in the future, most stringent measures
must be taken in the occupied territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The choice of hostages is also indicated thus in Document Number
877-PS, which has already been read to you and which is previous
to the aggression of Germany against Russia. It is necessary
to remind the Tribunal of this document because it shows the
premeditation of the German Command and the Nazi Government
to divide the occupied countries, to take away from the partisan
resistance all its patriotic character, in order to substitute for it
a political character which it never had. We submit this document
under Exhibit Number RF-273:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this connection it must be borne in mind that, apart from
other adversaries with whom our troops have to contend,
there is a particularly dangerous element of the civilian population
which is destructive of all order and propagates Jewish-Bolshevist
philosophy. There is no doubt that, wherever he
possibly can, this enemy uses this weapon of disintegration
cunningly and in ambush against the German forces which are
fighting and liberating the country.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is an official document issued by the headquarters
of the High Command of the Army. It expresses the general
doctrine of all the German Staff. It is Keitel who presides over the
formation of this doctrine. He is therefore not only a soldier under
the orders of his government; but at the same time that he is a
general, he is also a Nazi politician whose acts are those of a war
leader and also those of a politician serving the Hitlerite policy.
You have proof of it in the document which I have just read to
you: A general who is also a politician, in whom both politics and
the conduct of war are combined in one single preoccupation. This
is not surprising for those who know the German line of thought,
which had never separated war and politics. Was it not Clausewitz
who said that war was only the continuation of politics by other
means?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is doubly important. This constitutes a direct and crushing
charge against Keitel; but Keitel is the German General Staff.
Now this organization is indicted, and we see by this document that
this indictment is justified as the German General Staff dabbled in
the criminal policy of the German Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of France, the general orders of Keitel were adapted
by Stülpnagel in his order of 30 September 1941, better known in
France under the name of “hostages code,” which repeats and
specifies in detail the previous order, namely that of 23 August 1941.
This order of 30 September 1941 is of major importance to anyone
who wishes to prove under what circumstances French hostages
were shot. This is why I shall be obliged to read large extracts. It
defines, in Paragraph 3, the categories of Frenchmen who will be
considered as hostages. I shall read this document 1588-PS, which
I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-274. Paragraph I
concerns the seizure of hostages. I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. On 22 August 1941, I issued the following announcement:</p>
<hr class='tbk150'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘On the morning of 21 August 1941, a member of the German
Armed Forces was killed in Paris as a result of a murderous
attack. I therefore order that:</p>
<hr class='tbk151'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘1. All Frenchmen held in custody of whatever kind, by the
German authorities or on behalf of German authorities in
France, are to be considered as hostages as from 23 August.</p>
<hr class='tbk152'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘2. If any further incident occurs, a number of these hostages
are to be shot, to be determined according to the
gravity of the attempt.’</p>
<hr class='tbk153'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. On 19 September 1941 by an announcement to the Plenipotentiary
of the French Government attached to the Military
Commander in France, I ordered that, as from 19 September
1941, all French males who are under arrest of any kind by
the French authorities or who are taken into custody because
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
of Communist or anarchistic agitation are to be kept under
arrest by the French authorities also on behalf of the Military
Commander in France.</p>
<hr class='tbk154'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. On the basis of my notification of the 22d of August 1941
and of my order of the 19th of September 1941 the following
groups of persons are therefore hostages:</p>
<hr class='tbk155'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) All Frenchmen who are kept in detention of any kind
whatsoever by the German authorities, such as police custody,
imprisonment on remand, or penal detention.</p>
<hr class='tbk156'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(b) All Frenchmen who are kept in detention of any kind
whatsoever by the French authority on behalf of the German
authorities. This group includes:</p>
<hr class='tbk157'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(aa) All Frenchmen who are kept in detention of any kind
whatsoever by the French authorities because of Communist
or anarchist activities.</p>
<hr class='tbk158'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(bb) All Frenchmen on whom the French penal authorities
impose prison terms at the request of the German military
courts and which the latter consider justified.</p>
<hr class='tbk159'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(cc) All Frenchmen who are arrested and kept in custody by
the French authorities upon demand of the German authorities
or who are being handed over by the Germans to French
authorities with the order to keep them under arrest.</p>
<hr class='tbk160'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(c) Stateless inhabitants who have already been living for
some time in France are to be considered as Frenchmen
within the meaning of my notification of the 22d of August
1941.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk161'/>
<p class='noindent'>“III. Release from detention.</p>
<hr class='tbk162'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Persons who were not yet in custody on 22 August 1941 or
on 19 September 1941 but who were arrested later or are
still being arrested are hostages as from the date of detention
if the other conditions apply to them.</p>
<hr class='tbk163'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The release of arrested persons authorized on account of
expiration of sentences, lifting of the order for arrest, or for
other reasons will not be affected by my announcement of
22 August 1941. Those released are no longer hostages.</p>
<hr class='tbk164'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In as far as persons are in custody of any kind with the
French authorities for Communist or anarchist activity, their
release is possible only with my approval as I have informed
the French Government.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk165'/>
<p class='noindent'>“VI. Lists of hostages.</p>
<hr class='tbk166'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If an incident occurs which according to my announcement
of 22 August 1941 necessitates the shooting of hostages, the
execution must immediately follow the order. The district
commanders, therefore, must select for their own districts
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
from the total number of prisoners (hostages) those who, from
a practical point of view, may be considered for execution
and enter them on a list of hostages. These lists of hostages
serve as a basis for the proposals to be submitted to me in
the case of an execution.</p>
<hr class='tbk167'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. According to the observations made so far, the perpetrators
of outrages originate from Communist or anarchist terror
gangs. The district commanders are, therefore, to select from
those in detention (hostages), those persons who, because of
their Communist or anarchist views in the past or their positions
in such organizations or their former attitude in other
ways, are most suitable for execution. In making the selection
it should be borne in mind that the better known the
hostages to be shot, the greater will be the deterrent effect
on the perpetrators, themselves, and on those persons who,
in France or abroad, bear the moral responsibility—as instigators
or by their propaganda—for acts of terror and sabotage.
Experience shows that the instigators and the political
circles interested in these plots are not concerned about the
life of obscure followers, but are more likely to be concerned
about the lives of their own former officials. Consequently, we
must place at the head of these lists:</p>
<hr class='tbk168'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) Former deputies and officials of Communist or anarchist
organizations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Allow me to make a comment, gentlemen. There never were
any anarchist organizations represented in parliament, in either of
our Chambers; and this paragraph (a) could only refer to former
deputies and officials of the Communist organizations, of whom
we know, moreover, that some were executed by the Germans as
hostages.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(b) Persons (intellectuals) who have supported the spreading
of Communist ideas by word of mouth or writing.</p>
<hr class='tbk169'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(c) Persons who have proved by their attitude that they are
particularly dangerous.</p>
<hr class='tbk170'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(d) Persons who have collaborated in the distribution of
leaflets.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One idea is dominant in this selection: “We must punish the
elite.” In conformity with paragraph (b) of this article, we shall
see that the Germans shot a great number of intellectuals, including
Solomon and Politzer, in 1941 and 1942, in Paris and in the provincial
towns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall come back to these executions later when I give you
examples of German atrocities committed in relation to the policy
of hostages in France.
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Following the same directives, a list of hostages is to be
prepared from the prisoners with De Gaullist sympathies.</p>
<hr class='tbk171'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Racial Germans of French nationality who are imprisoned
for Communist or anarchist activity may be included in the
list. Special attention must be drawn to their German origin
on the attached form.</p>
<hr class='tbk172'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Persons who have been condemned to death but who have
been pardoned, may also be included in the lists.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk173'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. The lists have to record for each district about 150 persons
and for the Greater Paris Command about 300 to 400
people. The district chiefs should always record on their
lists those persons who had their last residence or permanent
domicile in their districts, because the persons to be executed
should, as far as possible, be taken from the district where
the act was committed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk174'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The lists are to be kept up to date. Particular attention is
to be paid to new arrests and releases.</p>
<hr class='tbk175'/>
<p class='noindent'>“VII. Proposals for executions:</p>
<hr class='tbk176'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In case of an incident which necessitates the shooting of hostages,
within the meaning of my announcement of 22 August
1941, the district chief in whose territory the incident happened
is to select from the list of hostages persons whose
execution he wishes to propose to me. In making the selection
he must, from the personal as well as local point of view,
draw from persons belonging to a circle which presumably
includes the guilty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip a paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For execution, only those persons who were already under
arrest at the time of the crime may be proposed.</p>
<hr class='tbk177'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The proposal must contain the names and number of the
persons proposed for execution, that is, in the order in which
the choice is recommended.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And, at the very end of Paragraph VIII, we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the bodies are buried, the burial of a large number in
a common grave in the same cemetery is to be avoided, in
order not to create places of pilgrimage which, now or later,
might form centers for anti-German propaganda. Therefore,
if necessary, burials must be carried out in various places.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Parallel to this document, concerning France, there exists in
Belgium an order of Falkenhausen of 19 September 1941, which you
will find on Page 6 of the official report on Belgium, Document
Number F-683, which I shall submit as Exhibit Number RF-275.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is the Belgian document worded in substantially
the same terms as the document you have just read?
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then I do not think you need to read that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: As you wish. Then it will not be necessary either
to read in entirety the warning of Seyss-Inquart concerning Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think that by referring to these exhibits in your document
book, you will be able to obtain items of evidence which will only
confirm what I read to you of Stülpnagel’s order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Norway and Denmark there is a teletyped letter from Keitel
to the Supreme Command of the Navy, dated 30 November 1944,
which you will find in the document book, as Document C-48 (Exhibit
Number RF-280). I read the end of Paragraph 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Every ship-yard worker must know that any act of sabotage
occurring within his sphere of activity entails for him
personally or for his relatives, if he disappears, the most
serious consequences.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 2 of Document Number 870-PS (Exhibit Number RF-281):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“4. I have just received a teletype from Field Marshal Keitel
requesting the publication of an order according to which the
personnel or, if need be, their near relatives (liability of next
of kin) will be held collectively responsible for the acts of
sabotage occurring in their factories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And Terboven, who wrote this sentence, added (and it is he
who condemns Marshal Keitel):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This request only makes sense and will only be successful if
I am actually allowed to have executions carried out by
shooting.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>All these documents will be submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, do I understand that in Belgium,
Holland, in Norway, and in Denmark, there were similar orders or
decrees with reference to hostages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Your Honor, I mean to read those concerning
Belgium, Holland, and Norway. For Belgium, for instance, you will
find at Page 6, Document Number F-683, which is the official document
of the Belgian Ministry of Justice:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Brussels, 29 November 1945, 1, rue de Turin. Decree of
Falkenhausen of 19 September 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk178'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the future, the population must expect that if attacks are
made on members of the German Army or the German Police
and the culprits cannot be arrested, a number of hostages
proportionate to the gravity of the offense, five at a minimum,
will be shot if the attack causes death. All political
prisoners in Belgium are, with immediate effect, to be considered
as hostages.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, I did not want you to read these
documents if they are substantially in the same form as the document
you have already read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They are more or less in the same form, Your
Honor. I shall submit them because they constitute the proof of the
systematic repetition of the same methods to obtain the same
results, that is, to cause terror to reign in all the occupied countries
of the West. But, if the Tribunal considers it constant and established
that these methods were systematically used in all the
western regions, naturally I shall spare you the reading of documents
which are monotonous and which repeat in substance what
was said in the document relating to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps you had better give us references
to the documents which concern Belgium, Holland, Norway, and
Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Your Honor, for Belgium, Document F-683,
Page 6, decree of Falkenhausen of 19 September 1941, submitted as
Exhibit Number RF-275, as constituting the official report of the
Kingdom of Belgium against the principal war criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second document is C-46, corresponding to UK-42 (24 November
1942), submitted as Exhibit Number RF-276.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Holland, a warning by Seyss-Inquart, Document Number
F-224, which you may feel it necessary for me to read, since Seyss-Inquart
is one of the defendants. I submit this document under
Exhibit Number RF-279, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the destruction or the damaging of railway installations,
telephone cables, and post offices I shall make responsible all
the inhabitants of the community on whose territory the act
is committed.</p>
<hr class='tbk179'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The population of these communities must expect that
reprisals will be taken against private property and that
houses or whole blocks will be destroyed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid I don’t know where you are
reading. Which paragraph are you reading?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am told, Mr. President, that this document has
not been bound with the Dutch report; I shall file it at the end of
the hearing, if I may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I quote now another document, the warning of
Seyss-Inquart to Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And that is what number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Number 152 in your document book, concerning
German justice, which will be submitted at the hearing tomorrow.
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>For Norway and Denmark we have several documents which
establish that the same policy of execution of hostages was followed.
We have, in particular, Document C-48 (Exhibit Number
RF-280) from which I read a short time ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All those special orders for each of the occupied regions of the
West are the result of the general order of Keitel, which my American
colleagues have already read and on which I merely gave a
comment this morning. The responsibility of Keitel in the development
of the policy of execution of hostages is total. He was given
warning; German generals even told him that this policy went
beyond the aim pursued and might become dangerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 16 September 1942, General Falkenhausen addressed a letter
to him, from which I extract the following passage—it is Document
Number 1594-PS, which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-283:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Enclosed is a list of the shootings of hostages which have
taken place until now in my area and the incidents on
account of which these shootings took place.</p>
<hr class='tbk180'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In a great number of cases, particularly in the most serious,
the perpetrators were later apprehended and sentenced.</p>
<hr class='tbk181'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This result is undoubtedly very unsatisfactory. The effect is
not so much deterrent as destructive of the feeling of the
population for right and security; the cleft between the people
influenced by communism and the remainder of the population
is being bridged; all circles are becoming filled with
a feeling of hatred toward the occupying forces and effective
inciting material is given to enemy propaganda. Thereby
military danger and general political reaction of an entirely
unwanted nature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—Signed—“Von Falkenhausen.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now present Document Number 1587-PS from the same
German general and he seems to be lucid:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In addition I wish once more to point out the following:</p>
<hr class='tbk182'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In several cases the authors of aggression or acts of sabotage
were discovered when the hostages had already been shot,
shortly after the criminal acts had been committed, according
to the instructions received. Moreover, the real culprits often
did not belong to the same circles as the executed hostages.
Undoubtedly in such cases the execution of hostages does not
inspire terror in the population but indifference to repressive
measures and even resentment on the part of some sections
of the population who until then had displayed a passive
attitude. The result for the occupying power is therefore
negative as planned and intended by the English agents, who
were often the instigators of these acts. It will therefore be
necessary to prolong the delay in cases where the arrest of
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
the culprits may yet be expected. I therefore request that
you leave to me the responsibility for fixing such delays, in
order that the greatest possible success in the fight against
terrorist acts may be obtained.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it known what the date of that document
was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is after the 16th of September 1941. We do not
have the exact date. The document is appended to another document,
the date of which is illegible; but it is after Keitel’s order
since it gives an account of the executions of hostages, carried out
in compliance with that order. It points out that after the execution
of the hostages the culprits were found; that the effect was deplorable
and aroused the resentment of some of the population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will find also in this Document Number 1587-PS—but this
time an extract from the monthly report of the Commander of the
Wehrmacht in the Netherlands—the report for the month of August
1942, a new warning to Keitel:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“B. Special events and the political situation:</p>
<hr class='tbk183'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On the occasion of an attempt against a train of soldiers on
furlough due to arrive in Rotterdam, a Dutch railway guard
was seriously wounded by touching a wire connected with an
explosive charge, thus causing an explosion. The following
repressive measures were announced in the Dutch press:</p>
<hr class='tbk184'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The deadline for the arrest of the perpetrators, with collaboration
of the population, is fixed at 14 August, midnight.
A reward of 100,000 florins will be made for a denunciation,
which will be treated confidentially. If the culprits are not
arrested within the time appointed, arrests of hostages are
threatened; railway lines will be guarded by Dutchmen.</p>
<hr class='tbk185'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Since, despite this summons, the perpetrator did not report
and was not otherwise discovered, the following hostages,
among whom some had already been in custody for several
weeks as hostages, were shot on the order of the Higher SS
and Police Führer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will pass over the enumeration of the names. I omit the next
paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Could you read the names and the titles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: “Ruys, Willem, Director General, Rotterdam; Count
E.O.G. Van Limburg-Stirum, Arnhem; M. Baelde, Robert, Doctor
of Law, Rotterdam; Bennenkers, Christoffel, former Inspector General
of the Police at Rotterdam; Baron Alexander Schimmelpennink
Van der Oye, Noordgouwe (Seeland).” One paragraph further on:
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Public opinion was particularly affected by the execution of
these hostages. Reports at hand express the opinion that,
from the beginning of the occupation, no stroke inflicted by
the Germans was more deeply felt. Many anonymous letters,
and even some signed ones, sent to the Commander of the
Wehrmacht, who was considered as responsible for this
‘unheard of event,’ show the varied reactions of the mass of
the Dutch people. From the bitterest insults to apparently
pious petitions and prayers not to resort to extremes, no
nuance was lacking which did not in one way or another
indicate, to say the least, complete disapproval and misunderstanding,
first of the threat, and secondly of the actual execution
of the hostages. Reproaches for this most severe infraction
of law (which were based on serious argument and often
gave rise to thought), and also cries of despair from idealists
who, in spite of all that had occurred in the political sphere,
had still believed in German-Dutch understanding but now
saw all was at an end—all this was found in the correspondence.
In addition, the objection was raised that such methods
were only doing the work of the Communists, who as the real
instigators of active sabotage must be very glad to couple
with their achievements the pleasure of the elimination of
‘such hostages.’</p>
<hr class='tbk186'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In short, such disapproval even in the ranks of the very few
really pro-German Dutch had never before been noticed, so
much hatred at one time had never been felt.”—signed—“Schneider,
Captain.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite these warnings proffered by conscientious subordinates,
neither the General Staff nor Keitel ever gave any order to the
contrary. The order of 16 September 1941 always remained in
force. When I have shown you examples of executions of hostages
in France, you will see that a number of facts which I shall utilize
are dated 1942, 1943 and even 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps we had better adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: If Your Honor please, the Defendants Kaltenbrunner
and Streicher will continue to be absent during this afternoon’s
session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Dubost, the Tribunal had some difficulty
this morning in following the documents that you were citing; and
also, the Tribunal understands the interpreters had some difficulty
because the document books, except the one that is before me, have
no indications of the “PS” or other numbers; and the documents
themselves are not numbered in order. Therefore it is extremely
difficult for members of the Tribunal to find documents, and it is
also extremely difficult for the interpreters to find any document
which may be before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, this afternoon, it will be appreciated if you will be so kind
as to indicate what the document is, and then give both the interpreters
and the Tribunal enough time in which they may find the
document, and then indicate exactly which part of the document
you are going to read, that is to say, whether it is the beginning
of the document, or the first paragraph, or the second, and so on.
But you must bear with us if we find some difficulty in following
you in the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Very well, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had finished this morning presenting the general rules which
prevailed during the five years of occupation in the matter of the
execution of numerous hostages in the occupied countries of the
West. I brought you the evidence, by reading a series of official
German documents, that the highest authorities of the Army, of the
Party, and of the Nazi Government had deliberately chosen to practice
a terroristic policy through the seizure of hostages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before passing to the examination of a few particular cases, it
seems to me to be necessary to say exactly wherein this policy consisted,
in the light of the texts which I have quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the circumstances, people belonging by choice or
ethnically to the vanquished nations were apprehended and held
as a guarantee for the maintenance of order in a given sector; or
after a given incident of which the enemy army had been the
victim. They were apprehended and held with a view to obtaining
the execution by the vanquished population of acts determined by
the occupying authority, such as denunciation, payment of collective
fines, the handing over of perpetrators of assaults committed
against the German Army, and the handing over of political adversaries;
and these persons thus arrested were often massacred subsequently
by way of reprisal.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>An idea emerges from methods of this kind, namely, that the
hostage, who is a human being, becomes a special security subjected
to seizure as determined by the enemy. How contrary this is
to the rule of individual liberty and human dignity. All the members
of the German Government are jointly responsible for this
iniquitous concept and for its application in our vanquished countries.
No member of the German Government can throw this
responsibility on to subordinates by claiming that they merely
executed clearly stated orders with an excess of zeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have shown you that upon many occasions, on the contrary,
the persons who carried out the orders reported to the chiefs the
moral consequences resulting from the application of the terroristic
policy of hostages. And we know that in no case were contrary
orders given. We know that the original orders were always maintained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not endeavor to enumerate in their totality all the cases
of executions of hostages. For our country, France, alone, there
were 29,660 executed. This is proved in Document Number F-420,
dated Paris, 21 December 1945, the original of which will be submitted
under Exhibit Number RF-266 to your Tribunal. It is at the
beginning of the document book, the second document. There in
detail, region by region, the number is given of the hostages who
were executed.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Region of: Lille, 1,143; Laon, 222; Rouen, 658; Angers, 863;
Orléans, 501; Reims, 353; Dijon, 1,691; Poitiers, 82; Strasbourg,
211; Rennes, 974; Limoges, 2,863; Clermont-Ferrand,
441; Lyons, 3,674; Marseilles, 1,513; Montpellier, 785; Toulouse,
765; Bordeaux, 806; Nancy, 571; Metz, 220; Paris, 11,000; Nice,
324; total, 29,660.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall limit my presentation to a few typical cases of executions
which unveil the political plan of the General Staff which prescribed
these executions—plans of terror, plans that were intended to create
and accentuate the division between Frenchmen, or, more generally,
between citizens of the occupied countries. You will find in your
document book a file quoted as F-133, which I submit as Exhibit
Number RF-288. This is called “Posters Concerning Paris.” At the
head of the page you will read, <span class='it'>Pariser Zeitung</span> supplement. This
document reproduces a few of the very numerous posters and bills,
some of the numerous notices inserted in the press from 1940 to
1945 announcing the arrest of hostages in Paris, in the Paris district,
and in France. I shall read only one of these documents, which you
will find on the second page, entitled Number 6, 19 September 1941.
You will see in it an appeal to informers, an appeal to traitors; you
will see in it a means of corruption, which systematically applied
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
to all the countries of the West for years; all tended to demoralize
them to an equal extent:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Appeal to the population of occupied territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk187'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 21 August a German soldier was fired on and killed by
cowardly murderers. In consequence I ordered on 23 August
that hostages be taken, and threatened to have a certain
number of them shot in case such an assault should be
repeated.</p>
<hr class='tbk188'/>
<p class='noindent'>“New crimes have obliged me to put this threat into execution.
In spite of this, new assaults have taken place.</p>
<hr class='tbk189'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I recognize that the great majority of the population is conscious
of its duty, which is to help the authorities in their
unremitting effort to maintain calm and order in the country
in the interest of this population.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And here is the appeal to informers:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“But among you there are agents paid by powers hostile to
Germany, Communist criminal elements who have only one
aim, which is to sow discord between the occupying power
and the French population. These elements are completely
indifferent to the consequences, affecting the entire population,
which result from their activity.</p>
<hr class='tbk190'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I will no longer allow the lives of German soldiers to be
threatened by these murderers. I shall stop at no measure,
however rigorous, in order to fulfill my duty.</p>
<hr class='tbk191'/>
<p class='noindent'>“But it is likewise my duty to make the whole population
responsible for the fact that, up to the present, it has not yet
been possible to lay hands on the cowardly murderers and
to impose upon them the penalty which they deserve.</p>
<hr class='tbk192'/>
<p class='noindent'>“That is why I have found it necessary, first of all for Paris,
to take measures which, unfortunately, will hinder the
everyday life of the entire population. Frenchmen, it depends
on you whether I am obliged to render these measures more
severe or whether they can be suspended again.</p>
<hr class='tbk193'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I appeal to you all, to your administration and to your police,
to co-operate by your extreme vigilance and your active
personal intervention in the arrest of the guilty. It is
necessary, by anticipating and denouncing these criminal
activities, to avoid the creation of a critical situation which
would plunge the country into misfortune.</p>
<hr class='tbk194'/>
<p class='noindent'>“He who fires in ambush on German soldiers, who are doing
only their duty here and who are safeguarding the maintenance
of a normal life, is not a patriot but a cowardly assassin
and the enemy of all decent people.
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk195'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Frenchmen! I count on you to understand these measures
which I am taking in your own interests also.”—Signed—“Von
Stülpnagel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Numerous notices follow which all have to do with executions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Number 8 on the following page you will find a list of
twelve names among which are three of the best known lawyers of
the Paris Bar, who are characterized as militant Communists, Messrs.
Pitard, Hajje and Rolnikas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In file 21 submitted by my colleague, M. Gerthoffer, in the
course of his economic presentation, you will find a few notices
which are similar, published in the German official journal VOBIF.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will observe, in connection with this notice of 16 September
announcing the execution or rather, the murder, of M. Pitard and
his companions, that the murderers had neither the courage nor
the honesty to say that they were all Parisian lawyers. Was it by
mistake? I think that it was a calculated lie, for at this time it
was necessary to handle the elite gently. The occupying power
still hoped to separate them from the people of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall describe to you in detail two cases which spread grief in
the hearts of the French in the course of the month of October 1941
and which have remained present in the memory of all my
compatriots. They are known as the “executions of Châteaubriant
and of Bordeaux.” They are related in Document Number F-415
in your document book, which I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit
Number RF-285.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the attack on two German officers at Nantes on 20 October
1941 and in Bordeaux a few days later, the German Army decided
to make an example. You will find, on Page 22 of Document
Number F-415, a copy of the notice in the newspaper <span class='it'>Le Phare</span>
of 21 October 1941.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Notice. Cowardly criminals in the pay of England and of
Moscow killed, with shots in the back, the Feldkommandant
of Nantes on the morning of 20 October 1941. Up to now the
assassins have not been arrested.</p>
<hr class='tbk196'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As expiation for this crime I have ordered that 50 hostages
be shot to begin with. Because of the gravity of the crime,
50 more hostages will be shot in case the guilty should not be
arrested between now and 23 October 1941 by midnight.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions under which these reprisals were exercised are
worth describing in detail. Stülpnagel, who was commanding the
German troops in France, ordered the Minister of the Interior to
designate prisoners. These prisoners were to be selected among the
Communists who were considered the most dangerous (these are
the terms of Stülpnagel’s order). A list of 60 Frenchmen was
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
furnished by the Minister of the Interior. This was Pucheu. He
has since been tried by my compatriots, sentenced to death, and
executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Subprefect of Châteaubriant sent a letter to the Kommandantur
of Châteaubriant, in reply to the order which he received
from the Minister of the Interior:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Following our conversation of today, I have the honor of
confirming to you that the Minister of the Interior has communicated
today with General Von Stülpnagel in order to
designate to him the most dangerous Communist prisoners
among those who are now held at Châteaubriant. You will
find enclosed herewith the list of 60 individuals who have
been handed over this day.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the following page is the German order:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Because of the assassination of the Feldkommandant of
Nantes, Lieutenant Colonel Hotz, on 20 October 1941, the
following Frenchmen, who were already imprisoned as
hostages in accordance with my publication of 22 August
1941 and of my ordinance to the Plenipotentiary General of
the French Government of 19 September 1941, are to be
shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the following pages you will find a list of all the men who
were shot on that day. I leave out the reading of the list in order
not to lengthen the proceedings unduly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 16 you will find a list of 48 names. On Page 13 you will
find the list of those who were shot in Nantes. On Page 12 you will
find the list of those who were shot in Châteaubriant. Their bodies
were distributed for burial to all the surrounding communes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall read to you the testimony of eyewitnesses as to how they
were buried after having been shot. On Page 3 of this document
you will find the note of M. Dumenil concerning the executions of
21 October 1941, which was written the day after these executions.
The second paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The priest was called at 11:30 to the prison of La Fayette.
An officer, probably of the GFP, told him that he was to
announce to certain prisoners that they were going to be shot.
The priest was then locked up in a room with the 13 hostages
who were at the prison. The other three, who were at les
Rochettes, were ministered to by Abbé Théon, professor at
the College Stanislas.</p>
<hr class='tbk197'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Abbé Fontaine said to the condemned, ‘Gentlemen, you
must understand, alas, what my presence means.’ He then
spoke with the prisoners collectively and individually for the
two hours which the officers had said would be granted to
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
arrange the personal affairs of the condemned and to write
their last messages to their families.</p>
<hr class='tbk198'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The execution had been fixed for 2 o’clock in the afternoon,
half an hour having been allowed for the journey. But the
two hours went by, another hour passed, and still another
hour before the condemned were sent for. Certain of them,
optimists by nature, like M. Fourny, already hoped that a
countermanding order would be given, in which the priest
himself did not at all believe.</p>
<hr class='tbk199'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The condemned were all very brave. It was two of the
youngest, Gloux and Grolleau, who were students, who
constantly encouraged the others, saying that it was better
to die in this way than to perish uselessly in an accident.</p>
<hr class='tbk200'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the moment of leaving, the priest, for reasons which
were not explained to him, was not authorized to accompany
the hostages to the place of execution. He went down the
stairs of the prison with them as far as the car. They were
chained together in twos. The thirteenth had on handcuffs.
Once they were in the truck, Gloux and Grolleau made
another gesture of farewell to him, smiling and waving their
hands that were chained together.</p>
<hr class='tbk201'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Signed: Dumenil, Counsellor attached to the Cabinet.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sixteen were shot in Nantes. Twenty-seven were shot in
Châteaubriant. Five were shot outside the department. For those
who were shot in Châteaubriant, we know what their last moments
were like. The Abbé Moyon, who was present, wrote on 22 October
1941 the account of this execution. This is the third paragraph,
Page 17 of your document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was on a beautiful autumn day. The temperature was
particularly mild. There had been lovely sunshine since
morning. Everyone in town was going about his usual
business. There was great animation in the town for it was
Wednesday, which was market day. The population knew
from the newspapers and from the information it had
received from Nantes that a superior officer had been killed
in a street in Nantes but refused to believe that such savage
and extensive reprisals would be applied. At Choisel Camp
the German authorities had, for some days, put into special
quarters a certain number of men who were to serve as
hostages in case of special difficulties. It was from among
these men that those who were to be shot on this evening of
22 October 1941 were chosen.</p>
<hr class='tbk202'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Curé of Béré was finishing his lunch when M. Moreau
Chief of Choisel Camp presented himself. In a few words
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
the latter explained to him the object of his visit. Having
been delegated by M. Lecornu, the subprefect of Châteaubriant,
he had come to inform him that 27 men selected
among the political prisoners of Choisel were going to be
executed that afternoon; and he asked Monsieur Le Curé to
go immediately to attend them. The priest said he was ready
to accomplish this mission, and he went to the prisoners
without delay.</p>
<hr class='tbk203'/>
<p class='noindent'>“When the priest appeared to carry out his mission, the
subprefect was already among the condemned. He came to
announce the horrible fate which was awaiting them, asking
them to write letters of farewell to their families without
delay. It was under these circumstances that the priest
presented himself at the entrance to the quarters.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You will find on Page 19 the “departure for the execution,”
Paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Suddenly there was the sound of automobile engines. The
door, which I had shut at the beginning so that we might be
more private, was abruptly opened and French constables
carrying handcuffs appeared. A German officer arrived. He
was actually a chaplain. He said to me, ‘Monsieur le Curé,
your mission has been accomplished and you must withdraw
immediately.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the bottom of the page, the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Access to the quarry where the execution took place was
absolutely forbidden to all Frenchmen. I only know that the
condemned were executed in three groups of nine men, that
all the men who were shot refused to have their eyes bound,
that young Mocquet fainted and fell, and that the last cry
which sprang from the lips of these heroes was an ardent
‘Vive la France.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 21 of the same document you will find the declaration
of Police Officer Roussel. It is also worth reading:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The 22 October 1941 at about 3:30 in the afternoon, I happened
to be in the Rue du 11 Novembre at Châteaubriant, and I saw
coming from Choisel Camp four or five German trucks, I
cannot say exactly how many, preceded by an automobile in
which was a German officer. Several civilians with handcuffs
were in the trucks and were singing patriotic songs, the
‘Marseillaise,’ the ‘Chant du Depart,’ and so forth. One of the
trucks was filled with armed German soldiers.</p>
<hr class='tbk204'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I learned subsequently that these were hostages who had just
been fetched from Choisel Camp to be taken to the quarry of
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
Sablière on the Soudan Road to be shot in reprisal for the
murder at Nantes of the German Colonel Hotz.</p>
<hr class='tbk205'/>
<p class='noindent'>“About two hours later these same trucks came back from the
quarry and drove into the court of the Châteaubriant, where
the bodies of the men who had been shot were deposited in a
cellar until coffins could be made.</p>
<hr class='tbk206'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Coming back from the quarry the trucks were covered and
no noise was heard, but a trickle of blood escaped from them
and left a trail on the road from the quarry to the castle.</p>
<hr class='tbk207'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The following day, on the 23rd of October, the bodies of the
men who had been shot were put into coffins without any
French persons being present, the entrances to the château
having been guarded by German sentinels. The dead were
then taken to nine different cemeteries in the surrounding
communes, that is, three coffins to each commune. The Germans
were careful to choose communes where there was no
regular transport service, presumably to avoid the population
going <span class='it'>en masse</span> to the graves of these martyrs.</p>
<hr class='tbk208'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I was not present at the departure of the hostages from the
camp nor at the shooting in the quarry of Sablière, as the
approaches to it were guarded by German soldiers armed with
machine guns.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Almost at the same time, in addition to these 48 hostages who
were shot, there were others—those of Bordeaux. You will find in
your document book, under Document Number F-400, documents
which have been sent to us by the Prefecture of the Gironde, which
we submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number RF-286.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them comes from the Bordeaux Section of Political
Affairs, and is dated 22 October 1941, Document F-400(b).</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the course of the conference, which took place last night
at the Feldkommandantur of Bordeaux, the German authorities
asked me to proceed immediately to arrest 100 individuals
known for their sympathy with the Communist Party or the
Gaullist movement, who will be considered as hostages, and
to make a great number of house searches.</p>
<hr class='tbk209'/>
<p class='noindent'>“These operations have been in process since this morning.
So far no interesting result has been called to my attention.
In addition, this morning at 11 o’clock the German authorities
informed me of the reprisal measures which they had decided
to take against the population.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These reprisal measures you will find set forth on Page “A” of
the same document in a letter addressed by General Von Faber
Du Faur, Chief of the Regional Administration of Bordeaux, to the
Prefect of the Gironde. I quote:
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Bordeaux, 23 October 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk210'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To the Prefect of the Gironde, Bordeaux.</p>
<hr class='tbk211'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As expiation for the cowardly murder of the Councillor of
War, Reimers, the Military Commander in France has ordered
50 hostages to be executed. The execution will take place
tomorrow.</p>
<hr class='tbk212'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In case the murderers should not be arrested in the very
near future, additional measures will be taken, as in the case
of Nantes.</p>
<hr class='tbk213'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have the honor of making this decision known to you.</p>
<hr class='tbk214'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Chief of the Military Regional Administration,”—signed—“Von
Faber Du Faur.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And in execution of this order, 50 men were shot. There is a
famous place in the surburbs of Paris which has become a place of
pilgrimage for the French since our liberation. It is the Fort of
Romainville. During the occupation the Germans converted this
fort into a hostage depot from which they selected victims when
they wanted to take revenge after some patriotic demonstration.
It is from Romainville that Professors Jacques Solomon, Decourtemanche,
Georges Politzer, Dr. Boer and six other Frenchmen
departed. They had been arrested in March 1942, tortured by the
Gestapo, then executed without trial in the month of May 1942,
because they refused to renounce their faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 19 August 1942, 96 hostages left this fort, among them M. Le
Gall, a municipal councillor of Paris. They left the fort of Romainville,
were transferred to Mont-Valérien and executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September 1942 an assault had been made against some
German soldiers at the Rex cinema in Paris. General Von Stülpnagel
issued a proclamation announcing that, because of this assault,
he had caused 116 hostages to be shot and that extensive measures
of deportation were to be taken. You will find an extract from this
newspaper in Document Number F-402(b) (Exhibit Number RF-287).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The notice was worded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As a result of assaults committed by Communist agents and
terrorists in the pay of England, German soldiers and French
civilians have been killed or wounded.</p>
<hr class='tbk215'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As reprisal for these assaults I have had 116 Communist
terrorists shot, whose participation or implication in terroristic
acts has been proved by confessions.</p>
<hr class='tbk216'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In addition, severe measures of repression have been taken.
In order to prevent incidents on the occasion of demonstrations
planned by the Communists for 20 September 1942, I ordered
the following:
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk217'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) From Saturday, 19 September 1942, from 3 o’clock in the
afternoon, until Sunday, 20 September 1942, at midnight, all
theaters, cinemas, cabarets, and other places of amusement
reserved for the French population shall be closed in the
Departments of the Seine, Seine-et-Oise, and Seine-et-Marne.
All public demonstrations, including sports, are forbidden.</p>
<hr class='tbk218'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) On Sunday, 20 September 1942, from 3 o’clock in the
afternoon until midnight, non-German civilians are forbidden
to walk about in the streets and public places in the Departments
of the Seine, Seine-et-Oise, and Seine-et-Marne. The
only exceptions are persons representing official services.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In actual fact, it was only on the day of 20 September that 46 of
these hostages were chosen from the list of 116. The Germans
handed newspapers of 20 September to the prisoners of Romainville,
announcing the decision of the Military High Command. It was,
therefore, through the newspapers that the prisoners of Romainville
learned that a certain number of them would be chosen at the end
of the afternoon to be led before the firing squad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All lived through that day awaiting the call that would be made
that evening. Those who were called knew their fate beforehand.
All died innocent of the crimes for which they were being executed,
for those who were responsible for the assault in the Rex cinema
were arrested a few days later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in Bordeaux that the 70 other hostages of the total of 116
announced by General Von Stülpnagel were executed. In reprisal
for the murder of Ritter, the German official of the Labor Front,
50 other hostages were shot at the end of September 1943 in Paris.
Here is a reprint of the newspaper article which announced these
executions to the French people—Document Number F-402(c).</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Reprisals against terroristic acts. Assaults and acts of
sabotage have increased in France recently. For this reason
50 terrorists, convicted of having participated in acts of
sabotage and of terrorism, were shot on 2 October 1943 by
order of the German authorities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>All these facts concerning the hostages of Romainville have been
related to us by one of the rare survivors, M. Rabaté, a mechanic
living at 69 Rue de la Tombe-Issiore, Paris, whose testimony was
taken by one of our collaborators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this testimony—Document Number F-402(a), which has
already been submitted as Exhibit Number RF-287—we read the
following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“There were 70 of us, including Professor Jacques Solomon,
Decourtemanche and Georges Politzer, Dr. Boer, and Messrs.
Engros, Dudach, Cadras, Dalidet, Golue, Pican who were shot
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
in the month of May 1942, and an approximately equal
number of women.</p>
<hr class='tbk219'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Some of us were transferred to the German quarter of the
Santé (a prison in Paris), but the majority of us were taken
to the military prison of Cherche-Midi (in Paris). We were
questioned in turn by a Gestapo officer in the offices of the
Rue des Saussaies. Some of us, especially Politzer and Solomon,
were tortured to such an extent that their limbs were
broken, according to the testimony of their wives.</p>
<hr class='tbk220'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, while questioning me, the Gestapo officer confirmed
this to me: I repeat his words:</p>
<hr class='tbk221'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Rabaté, here you will have to speak. Professor Langevin’s
son-in-law, Jacques Solomon, came in here arrogant. He went
out crawling.’</p>
<hr class='tbk222'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After a short stay of 5 months in the prison of Cherche-Midi,
in the course of which we learned of the execution as hostages
of the 10 prisoners already mentioned, we were transferred
on 24 August 1942 to the Fort of Romainville.</p>
<hr class='tbk223'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is to be noted that from the day of our arrest we were
forbidden to write, or to receive mail, or inform our families
where we were. On the doors of our cells was written, ‘Alles
verboten’ (‘Everything is forbidden’). We received only the
strict food ration of the prison, namely, three-fourths of a
liter of vegetable soup and 200 grams of black bread per day.
The biscuits sent to the prison for political prisoners by the
Red Cross or by the Quakers’ Association were not given to
us because of this prohibition.</p>
<hr class='tbk224'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the Fort of Romainville we were interned as ‘isolated
prisoners,’ an expression corresponding to the ‘NN’ (Nacht
und Nebel), which we knew about in Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, the Tribunal thinks that, unless
there is anything very special that you wish to read in any of these
documents, they have already heard the number of the hostages
who were put to death and they think that it really does not add to
it—the actual details of these documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thought, Mr. President, that I had not spoken to
you of the regime to which men were subjected when they were
prisoners of the German Army. I thought that it was my duty to
enlighten the Tribunal on the condition of these men in the German
prisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought that it was also my duty to enlighten the Tribunal on
the ill-treatment inflicted by the Gestapo, who left the son-in-law
of Professor Langevin with his limbs broken. Moreover that is
found in a testimony.
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly, if there are matters of that sort
which you think it right to go into, you must do so; but the actual
details of individual shooting of hostages we think you might, at
any rate, summarize. But if there are particular atrocities which
you wish to draw our attention to, by all means do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I have only given two examples of
executions out of the multiple executions which caused 29,660 deaths
in my country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, M. Dubost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In the region of the North of France, which was
administratively attached to Belgium and subjected to the authority
of General Von Falkenhausen, the same policy of execution was
practiced. You will find in Document Number F-133, submitted as
Exhibit Number RF-289, copies of a great number of posters
announcing either arrests, executions, or deportations. Certain of
these posters include, moreover, an appeal to informers, and they
are analogous to those which I read to you in connection with
France. Perhaps it would be well, nevertheless, to point out the
one that you will find on Page 3, which concerns the execution of
20 Frenchmen, ordered as the result of a theft; that on Page 4, which
concerns the execution of 15 Frenchmen, ordered as a result of an
attack against a railroad installation; and finally, especially the last,
the one that you will find on Pages 8 and 9, which announces that
executions will be carried out, and invites the civilian population
to hand over the guilty ones, if they know them, to the German
Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As concerns especially the countries of the West other than
France, we have a very great number of identical cases. You will
find in your document book, under Document Number F-680, Exhibit
Number RF-290, a copy of a poster by the Military Commander-in-Chief
for Belgium and the North of France, which announces the
arrest in Tournai, on 18 September 1941, of 25 inhabitants as
hostages, and specifies the condition under which certain of them
will be shot if the guilty are not discovered. But you will find
especially, under the Number F-680(a) a remarkable document; it
comes from the German authorities themselves. It is the secret
report of the German Chief of Police in Belgium dated 13 December
1944, that is to say, when Belgium was totally liberated and this
German official wished to give an account to his chiefs of his
services during the occupation of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the first page of this document we take the following
passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The increasing incitement of the population, by enemy radio
and enemy press, to acts of terrorism and sabotage”—this is
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
applied to Belgium—“the passive attitude of the population,
particularly that of the Belgian administration, the complete
failure of the public prosecutors, the examining judges, and
of the police to disclose and prevent terrorist acts, have finally
led to preventive and repressive measures of the most rigorous
kind, that is to say, to the execution of persons closely related
to the culprits.</p>
<hr class='tbk225'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Already on 19 October 1941, on the occasion of the murder
of two police officials in Tournai, the Military Commander-in-Chief
declared through an announcement appearing in the
press that all the political prisoners in Belgium would be
considered as hostages with immediate effect. In the provinces
of the north of France, subject to the jurisdiction of the same
Military Commander-in-Chief, this ordinance was already in
force as from 26 August 1941. Through repeated notices
appearing in the press the civilian population has been informed
that political prisoners taken as hostages will be
executed if the murders continue to be committed.</p>
<hr class='tbk226'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As a result of the assassination of Teughels, Rexist major of
Charleroi, and other attempts at assassination of public
officials, the Military Commander-in-Chief has been obliged
to order, for the first time in Belgium, the execution of eight
terrorists. The date of the execution is 27 November 1942.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the following page of this same document—Number F-680(b)—you
will find another order dated 22 April 1944, secret, and issued
by the Military Commander in Belgium and the North of France,
concerning measures of reprisal for the murder of two Walloon SS,
who had fought at Tcherkassy; five hostages were shot on that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following page nine hostages are added to these five,
and still a tenth on the next page. Then five others on the
following page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will find, finally, on the next to the last page of the document,
a proposed list of persons to be shot in reprisal for the murder
of SS men. Compare the dates, and judge the ferocity with which
the assassination of these two Walloon traitors, SS volunteers, was
revenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, you will see the names of the 20 Belgian patriots who
were thus murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: As far as the other western countries, Holland and
Norway, are concerned, we have received documents which we
submit as Document Number F-224(b), Exhibits RF-291, 292, and 293.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the French text you will find a long list of civilians who were
executed. Also you will find a report of the Chief of the Criminal
Police, Munt, in connection with these executions, and you will
observe that Munt tries to prove his own innocence, in my opinion
without success. This is in Document Number RF-277, already
submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 6 you will find the report of an investigation concerning
mass executions carried out by the Germans in Holland. I do not
think it is necessary to read this report. It brings no new factual
element and simply illustrates the thesis that I have been presenting
since this morning: That in all the western countries the German
military authorities systematically carried out executions of hostages
as reprisals for acts of resistance. You will see that on 7 March 1945
an order was given to shoot 80 prisoners, and the authority who
gave this order said, “I don’t care where you get your prisoners”—execution
without any designation of age or profession or origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will see that a total of 2,080 executions was reached.
It will be noted that as a reprisal for the murder of an SS soldier,
a house was destroyed and 10 Dutchmen were executed; and in
addition, two other houses were destroyed. In another case
10 Dutchmen were executed. Altogether, 3,000 Dutchmen were
executed under these conditions, according to the testimony of this
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
document, which was drawn up by the War Crimes Commission,
signed by the Chief of the Dutch Delegation to the International
Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, Colonel Baron Van Tuyll van
Serooskerken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document gives to the Tribunal the approximate number of
victims, region by region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not wish to conclude the statement as to hostages concerning
Holland without drawing the attention of the Tribunal to Section (b)
of Document Number F-224, which gives a long list of hostages,
prisoners or dead, arrested by the Germans in Holland; for the
Tribunal will observe that most of the hostages were intellectuals
or very highly placed personages in Holland. We note, therein, the
names of members of parliament, lawyers, senators, Protestant
clergymen, judges, and amongst them we find a former Minister of
Justice. The arrests were made systematically among the intellectual
elite of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as Norway is concerned, the Tribunal will find in Document
Number F-240, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-292, a short
report of the executions which the Germans carried out in that
country:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 26 April 1942 two German policemen who tried to arrest
two Norwegian patriots were killed on an island on the west
coast of Norway. In order to avenge them, 4 days later
18 young men were shot without trial. All these 18 Norwegians
had been in prison since the 22 February of the same year
and therefore had nothing to do with this affair.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the first paragraph of the French translation in the French
document book, which is Page 22 of the Norwegian original, it
states that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 6 October 1942, 10 Norwegian citizens were executed in
reprisal for attempts at sabotage.</p>
<hr class='tbk231'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 20 July 1944 an indeterminate number of Norwegians
were shot without trial. They had all been taken from a concentration
camp. The reason for this arrest and execution is
unknown.</p>
<hr class='tbk232'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Finally, after the German capitulation, the bodies of 44 Norwegian
citizens were found in graves. All had been shot and
we do not know the reason for their execution. It has never
been published, and we do not believe they were tried. The
executions were effected by a shot through the back of the
neck or a revolver bullet through the ear, the hands of the
victims being tied behind their backs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This information is given by the Norwegian Government for this
Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I draw the attention of the Tribunal to a final document, Number
R-134 (Exhibit Number RF-293), signed by Terboven, which
concerns the execution of 18 Norwegians who were taken prisoners
for having made an illegal attempt to reach England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is by thousands and tens of thousands that in all the western
countries citizens were executed without trial in reprisal for acts in
which they never participated. It does not seem necessary to me to
multiply these examples. Each of these examples involves individual
responsibility which is not within the competency of this Tribunal.
The examples are only of interest in so far as they show that the
orders of the defendants were carried out and notably the orders
of Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that I have amply proved this. It is incontestable that
in every case the German Army was concerned with these executions,
which were not solely carried out by the police or the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, they did not achieve the results expected. Far from
reducing the number of attacks, it increased them. Each attempt
was followed by an execution of hostages, and every shooting of
hostages occasioned more attacks in revenge. Generally the
announcement of new executions of hostages plunged the countries
into a stupor and forced every citizen to become conscious of the
fate of his land, despite the efforts of German propaganda. Faced
with the failure of this terroristic policy, one might have thought
that the defendants would modify their methods. Far from
modifying them, they intensified them. I shall endeavor to show
the activity of the police and the law from the time when, the
policy of hostages having failed, it was necessary to appeal to
the German police in order to keep the occupied countries in a
state of servitude. The German authorities made arbitrary arrests
at all times and from the very beginning of the occupation; but
with the failure of the policy of executing hostages, which was—as
you remember—commented upon by General Von Falkenhausen in
the case of Belgium, arbitrary arrests increased to the point of
becoming a constant practice substituted for that of killing hostages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit to the Tribunal Document Number 715-PS, Exhibit
Number RF-294. This document concerns the arrest of high-ranking
officers who were to be transferred to Germany in honorable
custody:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Measures to be taken against French Officers.</p>
<hr class='tbk233'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In agreement with the German Embassy in Paris and with
the Chief of the Security Police and the SD, the Supreme
Commander in the West has made the following proposals:</p>
<hr class='tbk234'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The senior officers enumerated below will be arrested
and transferred to Germany in honorable custody:
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
“Generals of the Army: Frère”—who died subsequently in
Germany after his deportation—“Gérodias, Cartier, Revers,
De Lattre de Tassigny, Fornel de la Laurencie, Robert de
Saint-Vincent, Laure, Doyen, Pisquendar, Mittelhauser,
Paquin;</p>
<hr class='tbk235'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Generals of the Air Force: Bouscat, Carayon, De Geffrier,
D’Harcourt, Mouchard, Mendigal, Rozoy;</p>
<hr class='tbk236'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Colonels: Loriot and Fonck.</p>
<hr class='tbk237'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is a question of generals whose names have a propaganda
value in France and abroad or whose attitude and abilities
represent a danger.</p>
<hr class='tbk238'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Moreover, we have chosen from the index of officers kept
by the ‘Arbeitsstab’ in France about 120 officers who have
distinguished themselves by their anti-German attitude during
the last two years. The SD has also given a list of about
130 officers previously accused. After the compilation of these
two lists, the arrest of these officers is to be arranged at a
later date, depending on the situation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk239'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. In the case of all officers of the French Army of the
Armistice, the Chief of the Security Police, in collaboration
with the Supreme Command West, will appoint a special
day for the whole territory for a check to be made by the
police of domiciles and occupations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And here are the most important passages:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As a measure of reprisal, families of suspected persons
who have already shown themselves to be resistants or
who might become so in the future, will be transferred as
internees to Germany or to the territory of eastern France.
For these the question of billeting and surveillance must first
of all be solved. Afterwards we contemplate as a later
measure the deprivation of their French nationality and the
confiscation of property, already carried out in other cases
by Laval.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The police and the army were involved in all of these arrests.
A telegram in cipher shows that the Minister of Foreign Affairs
himself was concerned in the matter. Document Number 723-PS,
which becomes Exhibit Number RF-295, will be read in this connection.
It is the third document of the document book. It is
addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and is dated Paris,
5 June 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the course of the conference which took place yesterday
with the representatives of the High Command West and the
SD, the following was agreed on concerning measures to be
taken:
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk240'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The aim of these measures must be to prevent, by precautionary
measures, the escape from France of any more
well-known soldiers and at the same time to prevent these
personages from organizing a resistance movement in the
event of an attempted landing in France by the Anglo-Saxon
powers.</p>
<hr class='tbk241'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The circle of officers here concerned comprises all who, by
their rank and experience or by their name, would
considerably strengthen the military command or the
political credit of the resistants, if they should decide to join
them. In the event of military operations in France we
must consider them as being of the same importance.</p>
<hr class='tbk242'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The list has been drawn up in agreement with the High
Command West, the Chief of the Security Police, and the
General of the Air Force in Paris.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not read these new names of high-ranking French officers
who were to be arrested but will go on further where the Tribunal
will see that the German authorities contemplated causing officers
already arrested by the French Government and under the surveillance
of the French authorities to undergo the same fate as
General De Lattre de Tassigny, General Laure, and General Fornel
de la Laurencie. These generals were to be literally torn away
from the French authorities to be deported.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of the present general situation and the contemplated
security measures, all the authorities here consider it
undesirable for these generals to remain in French custody,
as the possibility must be considered that either through
negligence or by intentional acts of the guard personnel,
they might escape and regain their liberty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Page 7, under Roman numeral IX, concerning reprisals
against families:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“General Warlimont had asked the Commander-in-Chief of
the Western Front to raise the question of reprisal measures
against the relatives of persons who had joined the resistance
and to submit any proposals.</p>
<hr class='tbk243'/>
<p class='noindent'>“President Laval declared himself ready, not long ago, to
take measures of this kind on behalf of the French Government;
but to limit himself to the families of some particularly
distinguished persons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I refer to the paragraph before the last of the telegraphic report
Number 3,486 of 29 May 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We must wait and see whether Laval is really willing to
apply reprisal measures in a practical way.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk244'/>
<p class='noindent'>“All those present at the meetings were in agreement that
such measures should be taken in any event, as rapidly as
possible, against families of well-known personages who had
become resistants. (For example, members of the families of
Generals Giraud, Juin, Georges, the former Minister of the
Interior, Pucheu, the Inspector of Finance Couve De Murville,
Leroy-Beaulieu, and others.)</p>
<hr class='tbk245'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The measures may also be carried out by the German
authorities, since the persons who have become resistants
are to be considered as foreigners belonging to an enemy
power and the members of their families are also to be
considered as such.</p>
<hr class='tbk246'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the opinion of those present, the members of these
families should be interned; the practical carrying-out of this
measure and its technical possibilities must be carefully
examined .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk247'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We might also study the question of whether these families
should be interned in regions particularly exposed to air
attacks, for instance, in the vicinity of dams, or in industrial
regions which are often bombed.</p>
<hr class='tbk248'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A list of families who are considered liable for internment
will be compiled in collaboration with the Embassy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this premeditation of criminal arrests we find the Defendant
Ribbentrop, the Defendant Göring, and the Defendant Keitel
involved; for it is their departments who made these proposals, and
we know that these proposals were agreed to—Document Number
720-PS, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-296, the second in your
document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a fact that these arrests were carried out. Members of the
family of General Giraud were deported. General Frère was deported
and died in a concentration camp. The orders were therefore
carried out. They were approved before being carried out, and
the approval inculpates the defendants whose names I have mentioned.
The arrests did not only affect high-ranking officers but
were much more extensive, and a great number of Frenchmen were
arrested. We have no exact statistics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, did you produce any evidence
for your last statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall bring you the proof of the arrest of
General Frère and his death in the concentration camp when I
deal with the concentration camps. With regard to the arrest and
death of several French generals in the concentration camps in
Dachau, the Tribunal still remembers the testimony of Blaha. So
far as the family of General Giraud is concerned, I shall endeavor
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
to bring proofs, but I did not believe it was necessary; it is a well-known
fact that the daughter of General Giraud was deported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am not sure that we can take judicial
notice of all facts which may be public knowledge in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall submit to the Tribunal the supplementary
proof concerning the generals who died while deported when I
deal with the question of the camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: General Frère died in Struthof Camp and we shall
explain the circumstances under which he was assassinated. In
addition, there exists in your document book a document numbered
F-417, Exhibit Number RF-297, which was captured among the
archives of the German Armistice Commission, which establishes
that the German authorities refused to free French generals who
were prisoners of war and whose state of health and advanced age
made it imperative that they should be released. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as this question is concerned the Führer has always
adopted an attitude of refusal, not only from the point of
view of their release but also with regard to their hospitalization
in neutral countries.</p>
<hr class='tbk249'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Release or hospitalization today is more out of question
than ever, since the Führer has only recently ordered the
transfer to Germany of all French generals living in France.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is signed by Warlimont, and in handwriting it is noted: “No
reply to be given to the French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Please retain as evidence only this last sentence: “—since the
Führer has only recently ordered the transfer to Germany of all
French generals living in France.” As I explained, however, these
arrests infinitely exceeded the relatively limited number of generals
or families of well-known persons envisaged by the document
which I have just read to the Tribunal: “Very many Frenchmen
will be arrested .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” We have no statistics; but we have an idea
of the number, which is considerable according to the figures given
for Frenchmen who died in French prisons alone, prisons which
had been placed under German command and were supervised by
German personnel during the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know that 40,000 Frenchmen died in the French prisons,
alone, in France, according to the official figures given by the
Ministry of Prisoners and Deportees. In the prison registry “Schutzhaft”
(protective custody) is written. My American colleagues
explained to the Tribunal what this protective custody meant when
they read Document Number 1723-PS, submitted under Number
USA-206. It is useless to return to this document. It is sufficient
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
to remind the Tribunal that imprisonment and protective custody
were considered by the German authorities as the strongest measure
of forceful education for any foreigners who would deliberately
neglect their duty towards the German community or compromise
the security of the German State; they had to act in accordance
with the general interests and adapt themselves to the discipline
of the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This protective custody was, as the Tribunal will remember,
a purely arbitrary detention. Those who were interned in protective
custody enjoyed no rights and could not vindicate themselves.
There were no tribunals at their disposal before which they
could plead their cause. We know now through official documents
which were submitted to us, particularly by Luxembourg, that
protective custody was carried out on a very large scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will read in Document Number F-229, already
submitted as Exhibit Number USA-243, Document L-215, a list of
25 persons arrested and placed in different concentration camps
under protective custody. The Tribunal will recall that our colleagues
drew its attention to the reason for the arrest of Ludwig,
who was merely strongly suspected of having aided deserters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidence of the application of protective custody in France is
given in our Document Number F-278, submitted as Exhibit
Number RF-300:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Copy attached to VAAP-7236 (g)—Secret. Ministry for Foreign

of the military authorities. By order, signed (illegible).”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was still involved in this question
of protective custody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grounds for this custody were, as the Ministry for Foreign
Affairs admits and according to the testimony of this document,
very weak; nevertheless, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs does not
forbid it. The arrests were carried out under multiple pretexts, but
all these pretexts may be summarized under two general ideas:
Arrests were made either for motives of a political nature or for
racial reasons. The arrests were individual or collective in both
cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pretexts of a political nature:</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1941 the French observed that there was a synchronism
between the evolution of political events and the rhythm of arrests.
The French Document Number F-274(i) (Exhibit Number RF-301),
which is at the end of your document book, will show this. A
description is given by the Ministry of Prisoners and Deportees of
the conditions under which these arrests took place, beginning in
1941—a critical period in the German history of the war, since it
was from 1941 that Germany was at war with the Soviet Union:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The synchronism between the evolution of political events
and the rhythm of arrests is evident. The suppression of the
line of demarcation, the establishment of resistance groups,
the formation of the Maquis resulting from forced labor, the
landings in North Africa and in Normandy, all had immediate
repercussions on the figures for arrests, of which the
maximum curve is reached for the period of May to August
1944, especially in the southern zone and particularly in the
region of Lyons.</p>
<hr class='tbk256'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We repeat that these arrests were carried out by the members
of all categories of the German repressive system: the
Gestapo in uniform or in plain clothes, the SD, the Gendarmerie,
particularly at the demarcation line, the Wehrmacht
and the SS.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk257'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The arrests took on the characteristics of collective operations.
In Paris, as a result of an attempted assassination, the
18th Arrondissement was surrounded by the Feldgendarmerie.
Its inhabitants, men, women, and children, could not return
to their homes and spent the night where they could find
shelter. A round-up was carried out in the arrondissement.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think that it is necessary to read the following paragraph,
which deals with the arrests at the University of Clermont-Ferrand,
which the Tribunal will certainly remember, and also the
arrests in Brittany in 1944, at the time of the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last paragraph, at the bottom of Page 11:
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the pretext of conspiracy or attempted assassinations,
whole families were made to suffer. The Germans resorted
to round-ups when compulsory labor no longer furnished
them sufficient workers.</p>
<hr class='tbk258'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Round-up in Grenoble, 24 December 1943, Christmas Eve.</p>
<hr class='tbk259'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Round-up in Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, in March 1944.</p>
<hr class='tbk260'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Round-up in Figeac in May 1944.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last paragraph, at the bottom of Page 11:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Most Frenchmen who were rounded up in this way were in
reality not used for work in Germany but were deported, to
be interned in concentration camps.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We might multiply the examples of these arbitrary arrests by
delving into official documents which have been submitted by
Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Holland, and Belgium. These
round-ups were never legally justified, they were never even
represented as an action taken in accordance with the pseudo-law
of hostages to which we have already referred. They were always
arbitrary and carried out without any apparent reason, or at any
rate, without its being possible for any act of a Frenchman having
motivated them even as a reprisal. Other collective arrests were
made for racial reasons. They were of the same odious nature as
the arrests made for political reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 5 of the official document of the Ministry of Prisoners
and Deportees, the Tribunal may read a few odious details connected
with these racial arrests.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Certain German policemen were especially entrusted to pick
out Jewish persons, according to their physiognomy. They
called this group ‘The Brigade of Physiognomists.’ This verification
sometimes took place in public as far as men were concerned.
(At the railway station at Nice, some were unclothed
at the point of a revolver.)</p>
<hr class='tbk261'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Parisians remember these round-ups, quarter by quarter.
Large police buses transported old men, women, and children
pell-mell and crowded them into the Velodrome d’Hiver under
dreadful sanitary conditions before taking them to Drancy,
where deportation awaited them. The round-up of the month
of August 1941 has gained sad renown. All the exits of the
subway of the 11th Arrondissement were closed and all the
Jews in that district were arrested and imprisoned. The
round-up of December 1941 was particularly aimed at intellectual
circles. Then there were the round-ups of July 1942.</p>

<p class='noindent'>“All the cities in the southern zone, particularly Lyons,
Grenoble, Cannes, and Nice, where many Jews had taken

refuge, experienced these round-ups after the total occupation
of France.</p>
<hr class='tbk263'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Germans sought out all Jewish children who had found
refuge with private citizens or with institutions. In May 1944
they proceeded to take into custody the children of the Colony
of Eyzieux, and to arrest children who had sought refuge in
the colonies of the U.G.I.F. in June and July 1944.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I do not believe that these children were enemies of the German
people, nor that they represented a danger of any kind to the German
Army in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps, M. Dubost, we had better break
off now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 25 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<div><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>FORTY-THIRD DAY</span><br/> Friday, 25 January 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: Your Honors, Defendants Kaltenbrunner and
Streicher will be absent from this morning’s session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your Honors, yesterday I was reading from an
official French document, which appears in your document book
under the title “Report of the Ministry for Prisoners of War and
Deportees.” It concerned the seizure by the Germans of Jewish
children in France, who were taken from private houses or public
institutions where they had been placed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With your permission I will come back to a statement which I
had previously made concerning the execution of orders, given by
the German General Staff with the approval of the German
Minister for Foreign Affairs, to arrest all French generals and, in
reprisal, to arrest, as well, all the families of these generals who
might be resistants, in other words, who were on the side of our
Allies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In accordance with Article 21 of the Charter the Tribunal will
not require facts of public knowledge to be proved. In the
enormous amount of facts which we submit to you there are many
which are known but are not of public knowledge. There are a few,
but nevertheless certain, facts which are both known and are also
of public knowledge in all countries. There is the famous case of
the deportation of the family of General Giraud, and I shall allow
myself to recall to the Tribunal the six principal points concerning
this affair. First: We all remember having learned through the
Allied radio that Madame Giraud, wife of General Giraud .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is it that you are going to ask us to
take judicial knowledge of with reference to the deportation of
General Giraud’s family?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have to ask the Tribunal, Mr. President, to
apply, as far as these facts are concerned, Article 21 of the Charter,
namely, the provision specifying that the Tribunal will not require
facts to be proved which are of public knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, I request the Tribunal to hear my statement of these
facts which we consider to be of public knowledge for they are
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
known not only in France but in America, since the American
Army participated in these events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The words of Article 21 are not “of public
knowledge” but “of common knowledge.” It is not quite the same
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Before me now I have the French translation of
the Charter. I am interpreting according to the French translation:
“The Tribunal will not require that facts of public knowledge
(“notoriété publique”) be proved.” We interpret these words thus:
it is not necessary to bring documentary or testifying proof of
facts universally known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You say “facts universally known”; but
supposing, for instance, the members of the Tribunal did not know
the facts? How could it then be taken that they were of common
knowledge? The members of the Tribunal may be ignorant of the
facts. At the same time it is difficult for them to take cognizance
of the facts if they do not know them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is a question of fact which will be decided by
the Tribunal. The Tribunal will say whether it does or does not
know that these six points which I shall recall to it are correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will retire.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal is of opinion that the facts
with reference to General Giraud’s deportation and the deportation
of his family, although they are matters of common knowledge or
of public knowledge within France, cannot be said to be of common
knowledge or of public knowledge within the meaning of Article 21,
which applies generally to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, if the French Prosecutors have governmental documents
or reports from France which state the facts with reference
to the deportation of General Giraud, the question assumes a
different aspect and if there are such documents the Tribunal will,
of course, consider them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I must bring proof that the crimes committed
individually by the leaders of the German police in each city and
in each region of the occupied countries of the West, were committed
in execution of the will of a central authority, the will of the
German Government, which permits us to charge all the defendants
one by one. I shall not be able to prove this by submitting German
documents. That you may consider it a fact, it is necessary that
you accept as valid the evidence which I am about to read. This
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
evidence was collected by the American and French armies and
the French Office for Inquiry into War Crimes. The Tribunal will
excuse me if I am obliged to read numerous documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This systematic will can only be proved by showing that
everywhere and in every case the German policy used the same
methods concerning patriots whom they interned or detained.
Internment or imprisonment in France was in civilian prisons
which the Germans had seized, or in certain sections of French
prisons which the Germans had requisitioned, which they occupied,
and which all French officials were forbidden to enter. The
prisoners in all these prisons were subject to the same regime. We
shall prove this by reading to you depositions of prisoners from
each of these German penal institutions in France or the western
occupied countries. This regime was absolutely inhuman. It just
allowed the prisoners to survive under the most precarious
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Lyons, at Fort Montluc, the women received as their only
food a cup of herb tea at 7 o’clock in the morning and a ladle of
soup with a small piece of bread at 5 o’clock in the evening. This
is confirmed by Document Number F-555, which you will find
the eleventh in your document book, which we submit as Exhibit
Number RF-302. The first page of this document, second paragraph,
is an analysis of the depositions which were received. It is
sufficient to refer to this analysis. I shall take a few lines from
the following deposition. The witness declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on their arrival at Fort Montluc, the prisoners who
were taken in the round-up by the Gestapo on 20 September
1943 were stripped of all their belongings. The prisoners
were treated in a brutal fashion. The food rations were
quite inadequate. The women’s sense of decency was not
respected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This testimony was received at Saint Gingolph, 9 October 1944.
It refers to the arrests made at Saint Gingolph, which were carried
out in the month of September 1943. The witness relates:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The young men returned from the interrogation with their
toes burned by means of cotton-wool pads which had been
dipped in gasoline; others had had their calves burned by
the flames of a blow torch; others were bitten by police
dogs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. RUDOLF MERKEL (Counsel for the Gestapo): The French
Prosecution submits here documents which do not represent sworn
affidavits. They are statements which do not show who took them.
As a matter of principle I formally protest against these mere
testimonies of persons who were not on oath. They cannot be
admitted as proof at this Trial.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that all you have to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Yes, sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will hear M. Dubost answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, the Charter, which goes so far as
to admit evidence of public knowledge, has not fixed any rules
as to the manner in which this evidence, being submitted to you
as proof, shall be presented. The Charter leaves the Tribunal to
decide on this or that document. The Charter leaves the Tribunal
free to decide whether such or such method of investigation is
acceptable. The way in which these investigations have been
carried out is regular according to the customs and usages of my
country. As a matter of fact, it is usual for all official records of
the police and gendarmerie to be accepted without the witnesses
being under oath. Moreover, according to the stipulations of the
Charter, all investigations made to disclose war crimes should be
held as authentic proof. Article 21 says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Tribunal shall not require proof of facts of common
knowledge but shall take judicial notice thereof. It shall also
take judicial notice of official governmental documents and
reports of the United Nations, including the acts and documents
of the committees set up in the various Allied countries
for the investigation of war crimes, and the records and
findings of military or other Tribunal of any of the United
Nations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, is the document that you are
reading to us either an official government document or a report,
or is it an act or document of a committee set up in France?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This report, Mr. President, comes from the Sûreté
Nationale. You can verify that by examining the second sheet of
the copy which you have in your hand, at the top to the left:
Direction Générale de la Sûreté Nationale. Commissariat Special
de Saint Gingolph. Testimony of witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: May we see the original document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This document was submitted to the Secretary of
the Tribunal. The Secretary has only to bring that document to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Is this a certified copy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is a copy certified by the Director of the
Cabinet of the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, I am told that the French
Prosecutors have all the original documents and are not depositing
them in the way it is done by the other prosecutors. Is that so?
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The French Prosecutors submitted the originals of
yesterday’s session, and they were handed over this morning to
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we wish to see the original document.
We understand it is in the hands of the French Secretary. We
should like to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have sent for it, Mr. President. This document is
a certified copy of the original, which is preserved in the archives
of the French Office for Inquiry into War Crimes. This certification
was made, on the one hand, by the French Delegate of the
Prosecution—you will see the signature of M. de Menthon on the
document you have—on the other, by the Director of the Cabinet
of the Minister of Justice, M. Zambeaux, with the official seal of
the French Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It does appear to be a governmental document.
It is the document of a committee set up by France for the
investigation of war crimes, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, it is a document which comes from
the Office of National Security (Direction Générale de la Sûreté
Nationale), which was set up in connection with an investigation
of War Crimes as prescribed by our French Office for Inquiry into
War Crimes. The original remains in Paris at the War Crimes
office, but the certified copy which you have was signed by the
Director of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Justice in Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, M. Dubost, I was not upon the question
of whether it was a true document or not; the question I was upon
was whether or not it was, within Article 21, either a governmental
document or a report of the United Nations, or a document of a
committee set up in France for the investigation of War Crimes;
and I was asking whether it is, and it appears to be so. It is, is
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to add anything to what you
have said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: No, I have nothing to add.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now, Dr. Merkel, you may speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: I should only like to stress briefly that these
statements which are presented here are not statements of an official
government agency and cannot be considered as governmental
records. Rather, they are only minutes which have been taken in
police offices and thus can in no way be authentic declarations of
a government or of an investigating committee. I emphasize once
more that these declarations, which have certainly been taken—partially
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
at least—in minor police precincts, have not been made
under oath and do not represent sworn statements; and I have
to protest firmly against their being considered as evidence here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to add anything?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Who is M. Binaud?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: He is the Police Inspector of the Special Police,
who was attached to the Special Commissariat of Saint Gingolph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must correct an error made by the Defense Counsel, who said
this was a minor police office. This was a frontier post. The
Special Commissariats at frontier posts are all important offices
even though they are located in very small towns. I think that is
the same in all countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, M. Dubost, you understand what the
problem is? It is a question of the interpretation of Article 21.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal requires your assistance upon
that interpretation, as to whether this document does come under the
terms of Article 21. If you have anything to say upon that subject
we will be glad to hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, it seems to me impossible that the
Tribunal should rule out this and similar documents which I am
going to present, for all these documents bear, for authentication,
not only the signature of the French representative at this Tribunal
but that of the Delegate of the Minister of Justice to the War
Crimes Commission as well. Examine the stamp beside the second
signature. It is the seal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do not go too fast; tell us where the
signatures are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST [<span class='it'>Indicating on the document.</span>]: Here, Your Honors,
is a notation of the release of this document by the Office for
Inquiry into War Crimes to the French Prosecutor as an element
of proof and below, the signature of the Director of the Cabinet
of the French Minister of Justice, the Keeper of the Seals, and in
addition, over this signature, the seal of the Minister of Justice.
You may read: “Office for Inquiry into War Crimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is this the substance of the matter: That this
was an inquiry by the police into these facts; and that police
inquiry was recorded; and then the Minister of Justice, for the
purposes of this Trial, adopted that police report? Is that the
substance of it?
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is correct, Mr. President. I think that we agree.
The Office for Inquiry into War Crimes in France is directly attached
to the Ministry of Justice. It carries out investigations. These
investigations are made by the police authorities, such as M. Binaud,
Inspector of Special Police, attached to the Special Commissariat of
Saint Gingolph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal would like to know when the
service of inquiry into War Crimes was established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I cannot give you the exact date from memory,
but this service was set up in France the day after the liberation.
It began to function in October 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was this service established after the police
report was made?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In the month of September or October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: September of what year?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In September 1944 this Office for Inquiry into War
Crimes in France was established, and this service functioned as
soon as the Provisional Government was set up in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the police inquiry was held under the
service? You see, the police report is dated the 9th of October, and
therefore the police report appears to have been made after the
service had been set up. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You have the evidence, Mr. President. If you look
at the top of the second page at the left, it shows the beginning of
the record and you read: “Purpose: Investigation of atrocities committed
by Germans against the civilian population.” These investigations
were prescribed by the Office for Inquiry into War
Crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. That would appear to be so if the
service was really established in September and this police investigation
is dated the 9th of October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will adjourn for consideration of this question.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has considered the arguments
which have been addressed to it and is of the opinion that the
document offered by counsel for France is a document of a committee
set up for the investigation of War Crimes within the
meaning of Article 21 of the Charter. The fact that it is not upon
oath does not prevent it being such a document within Article 21, of
which the Tribunal is directed to take judicial notice. The question
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
of its probative value would of course be considered under Article 19
of the Charter and therefore, in accordance with Article 19 and Article
21 of the Charter, the document will be admitted in evidence;
and the objection of Counsel for the Gestapo is denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal would wish that all original documents should be
filed with the General Secretary of the Tribunal and that when
they are being discussed in Court, the original documents should be
present in Court at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR LUDWIG BABEL (Counsel for the SS and SD): I have
been informed that General Giraud and his family were probably
deported to Germany upon the orders of Himmler, but that they
were treated very well and that they were billeted in a villa; that
they were brought back to France in good health; that things went
well with them and that they are still well today. I do not see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel, forgive me for interrupting you, but
the Tribunal are not now considering the case of General Giraud
and his family. Are you unable to hear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What I was saying was that you were making some application
in connection with the deportation of General Giraud and were
stating facts to us—what you allege to be facts—as to that deportation.
The Tribunal is not considering that matter. The Tribunal
has already ruled that it cannot take judicial notice of the facts as
to General Giraud’s deportation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I was of the opinion that what I had to say
might bring about an explanation by the Prosecution and might
expedite the trial in that respect. That was the purpose of my
inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am merely pointing out to you that we are
not now considering General Giraud’s case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If the Tribunal will permit me to continue? It
seems to me necessary to come back to the proof which I propose to
submit. I have to show that, through uniformity of methods, the
tortures which were inflicted in each bureau of the German Police .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you finished the document we have
just admitted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Mr. President; I have completed this and I
will now read from other documents. But first I would like to sum
up the proofs which I have to submit this morning through the
reading of these documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that I was going to demonstrate how through the uniformity
of ill-treatment inflicted by all branches of the German
Police upon prisoners under interrogation, we are able to trace a
common will for which we cannot give you direct proof—as we did
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
yesterday, regarding hostages, by bringing you papers signed in
particular by Keitel—but we shall arrive at it by a way just as
certain, for this identity of method implies a uniformity of will,
which we can place only at the very head of the police, that is to
say, the German Government, to which the defendants belonged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document, Number F-555, Exhibit Number RF-302, from
which I have just read, refers to the ill-treatment of prisoners at
Fort Montluc in Lyons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Document Number F-556, which we shall submit as
Exhibit Number RF-303, which relates to the prison regime at
Marseilles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will note that this is an official record drawn up
by the military security service of Vaucluse concerning the atrocities
committed by Germans upon political prisoners and that this record
includes the written deposition of M. Mousson, chief of an intelligence
service, who was arrested on 16 August 1943 and then transferred
on 30 August 1943 to St. Pierre prison at Marseilles. At the last
paragraph of the first page of this document we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Transferred to Marseilles, St. Pierre prison, on 30 August 1943,
placed in room P, 25 meters long, 5 meters wide. We are
crammed up 75 and often 80. Two straw mattresses for three.
Repulsive hygienic conditions: lice, fleas, bed-bugs, tainted
food. For no reason at all comrades are beaten and put in
cells for 2 or 3 days without food.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Following page, fourth paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Taken into custody again 15 May in a rather brutal way”—this
is the 4th paragraph—“I was imprisoned in the prison of
Ste. Anne and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>5th paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Living conditions in Ste. Anne: deplorable hygiene; food
supplied by National Relief.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Next page, second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Living conditions in Petites Beaumettes: Food, just enough
to keep one alive; no packages; Red Cross gives many, but we
receive few.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This concerns, I repeat, prisons entirely under control of the
Germans. Regarding conditions at the prison of Poitiers, we submit
Document Number F-558, Exhibit Number RF-304. A report is
attached from the Press Section of the American Information Service
in Paris, dated 18 October 1944. The Tribunal should know that all
these reports were included with the documents which were presented
by the French Office for Inquiry into War Crimes. We read
under number two:
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“M. Claeys was arrested 14 December 1943 by the Gestapo
and imprisoned in the Pierre Levee Prison until 26 August
1944 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk264'/>
<p class='noindent'>“While in prison he asked for a mattress, as he had been
wounded in the war. He was told that he would get it if he
confessed. He had to sleep on 1 inch of straw on the ground.
Seven men in one room 4 meters long, 2 meters wide, and
2.8 meters in height.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For 20 days did not go out of cell.
WC was a great discomfort to him because of wounds. The
Germans refused to do anything about it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 4(b).</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Another prisoner weighed 120 kilograms and lost 30 kilograms
in a month. Was in isolation cell for a month. Was
tortured there and died of gangrene of legs due to wounds
caused by torture. Died after 10 days of agony alone and
without help.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 5.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Methods of torture:</p>
<hr class='tbk265'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) Victim was kept bent up by hands attached around right
leg. Was then thrown on the ground and flogged for 20 minutes.
If he fainted, they would throw a pail of water in his
face. This was to make him speak.</p>
<hr class='tbk266'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Mr. Francheteau was flogged like that four days out of six.
In some cases, subject was not tied. If he fell they would pick
him up by his hair, and go on.</p>
<hr class='tbk267'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At other times the victim was put naked in a special punishment
cell; his hands were tied to an iron grill above his head.
He was then beaten until made to talk.</p>
<hr class='tbk268'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(b) Beating as above was not common, but M. Claeys has
friends who have seen electric tortures. One electric wire
was attached to the foot and another wire placed at different
points on the body.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 6.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The tortures were all the more horrible because the Germans
in many cases had no clear idea of what information
they wanted and just tortured haphazard.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And at the very end, the five last lines.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“One torture consisted in hanging up the victims by the
hands, which were tied behind the back, until the shoulders
were completely dislocated. Afterwards, the soles of the feet
were cut with razor blades and then the victims were made
to walk on salt.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the prisons of the north, I submit Document
Number F-560, Exhibit Number RF-305. It also comes from the
American War Crimes Commission. On Page 1, under the letter
“A” you will find a general report of Professor Paucot on the
atrocities committed by the Germans in Northern France and in
Belgium. The report covers the activities of the German police
in France, at Arras, Béthune, Lille, Valenciennes, Malo les Bains,
La Madeleine, Quincy, and Loos; in Belgium, at Saint-Gilles, Fort
de Huy, and Camp de Belveroo. This report is accompanied by
73 depositions of victims. From examination of these testimonies
the fact emerges that the brutality, the barbarity of methods used
during the interrogations was the same in the various places cited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This synthesis which I have just mentioned is from the American
report. It seems to me unnecessary to stress this as it is confirmed
on the first page. The Tribunal can read further on Pages 4,
5, 6, and 7 a detailed description of the atrocities, systematic and
all identical, which the German police inflicted to force confessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 5, the fifth paragraph, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A prisoner captured while trying to escape was delivered
in his cell to the fury of police dogs who tore him to pieces.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 17, second paragraph, of the German text (Page 14 of
the French text) there is the report of M. Prouille, which, by exception,
I shall read because of the nature of the facts. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Condemned by the German Tribunal to 18 months of imprisonment
for possessing arms and after having been
in the prisons of Arras, Béthune and Loos, I was sent to
Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk269'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As a result of ill-treatment in eastern Prussia I was obliged
to have my eyes looked after. Having been taken to an
infirmary, a German doctor put drops in my eyes. A few
hours later, after great suffering, I became blind. After
spending several days in the prison of Fresnes, I was sent to
the clinic of Quinze-Vingts in Paris. Professor Guillamat,
who examined me, certified that my eyes had been burned
by a corrosive agent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Under the Number F-561 I shall read a document from the
American War Crimes Commission, which we submit as Exhibit
Number RF-306. The Tribunal will find on Page 2 the proof that
M. Herrera was present at tortures inflicted on numerous persons,
and saw a Pole, by the name of Riptz, have the soles of his feet
burned. Then his head was split open with a spanner. After the
wound had healed he was shot. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Commander Grandier, who had had a leg fractured in the
war of 1914, was threatened by those who conducted the interrogations
with having his other leg broken and this was
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
actually done. When he had half revived, as a result of a
hypodermic injection, the Germans did away with him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We do not want to use more of your time than is necessary,
but the Tribunal should know these American official
documents in entirety, all of which show in a very exact way the
tortures carried out by the various German police services in
numerous regions of France, and give evidence of the similarity
of the methods used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following document is Number F-571, which we submit as
Exhibit Number RF-307, and of which we shall read only one four-line
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“M. Robert Vanassche, from Tourcoing, states: ‘I was arrested
the 22 February 1944 at Mouscron in Belgium by men belonging
to the Gestapo who were dressed in civilian clothing.
During the interrogation they were wearing uniforms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip a paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘I was interrogated for the second time at Cand in the
main German prison, where I remained 31 days. There I
was locked up for 2 or 3 hours in a sort of wooden coffin
where one could breathe only through three holes in the top.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further, the same, document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“M. Rémy, residing at Armentières, states: ‘Arrested 2 May
1944 at Armentières, I arrived at the Gestapo, 18 Rue François
Debatz at La Madelaine about 3 o’clock the same day. I was
subjected to interrogation on two different occasions. The
first lasted for about an hour. I had to lie on my stomach and
was given about 120 lashes. The second interrogation lasted
a little longer. I was lashed again, lying on my stomach.
As I would not talk, they stripped me and put me in the
bath tub. The 5th of May I was subjected to a new interrogation
at Loos. That day they hung me up by my feet
and rained blows all over my body. As I refused to speak,
they untied me and put me again on my stomach. When
pain made me cry out, they kicked me in the face with
their boots. As a result I lost 17 lower teeth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The names of two of the torturers follow, but are of no concern
to us here. We are merely trying to show that the torturers everywhere
used the same methods. This could have been done only
in execution of orders given by their chiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will further quote the testimony of M. Guérin:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as I would not admit anything, one of the interrogators
put my scarf around my mouth to stifle my cries. Another
German policeman took my head between his legs and two
others, one on each side of me, beat me with clubs over
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
the loins. Each of them struck me 25 times .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This lasted
over two hours. The next morning they began again and it
lasted as long as the day before. These tortures were inflicted
upon me because, on 11 November, I with my comrades of
the resistance had taken part in a demonstration by placing a
wreath on the monument to the dead of the 1914-18 war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now quote the report of Mr. Alfred Deudon. Here is the
ill-treatment to which he was subjected:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“18 August, sensitive parts were struck with a hammer.
19 August, was held under water; 20 August, my head was
squeezed with an iron band; 21 and 24 August, I was chained
day and night; 26 August, I was chained again day and night;
and at one time hung up by the arms.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will now read an extract from the report of M. Delltombe,
arrested by the Gestapo 14 June 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Thursday, 15 June, at 8 o’clock in the morning, I was taken
to the torture cellar. There they demanded that I should
confess to the sabotage which I had carried out with my
groups and denounce my comrades as well as name my hiding
places. Because I did not answer quickly enough, the torture
commenced. They made me put my hands behind my back.
They put on special handcuffs and hung me up by my wrists.
Then they flogged me, principally on the loins, and in the
face. That day the torture lasted 3 hours.</p>
<hr class='tbk270'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Friday, 16 June, the same thing took place; but only for an
hour and a half, for I could not stand it any longer; and they
took me back to my cell on a stretcher.</p>
<hr class='tbk271'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Saturday the tortures began again with even more severity.
Then I was obliged to confess my sabotage, for the brutes
stuck needles in my arms. After that they left me alone until
10 August; then they had me called to the office and told
me I was condemned to death. I was put on a train of
deportees going to Brussels, from which I was freed on
3 September by Brussels patriots.</p>
<hr class='tbk272'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. women were subjected to the same treatment as men.
To the physical pain, the sadism of the torturers added the
moral anguish, especially mortifying for a woman or a young
girl, of being stripped nude by her torturers. Pregnancy did
not save them from lashes. When brutality brought about
a miscarriage, they were left without any care, exposed to
all the hazards and complications of these criminal abortions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is the text of the summary drawn up by the American officer
who carried out this investigation.
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is the report of Madame Sindemans, who was arrested in
Paris 24 February 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by four soldiers, each armed with a submachine gun,
and two other Germans in civilian clothes holding revolvers.</p>
<hr class='tbk273'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Having looked into my handbag, they found three identification
cards. Then they searched my room and discovered
the pads and stamp of the Kommandantur and some German
passes and employment cards which I had succeeded in
stealing from them the day before .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk274'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Immediately, they placed handcuffs upon me and took me
to be interrogated. When I gave no reply, they slapped
me in the face with such force that I fell from my chair.
Then they struck me with a rubber ring across the face. This
interrogation began at 10 o’clock in the morning and ended
at 11 o’clock that night. I must tell you that I had been
pregnant for 3 months.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We shall submit now Documents F-563 and 564 under the one
number Exhibit Number RF-308. It is a report concerning the
atrocities committed by the Gestapo in Bourges. We shall read a
part of this report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, how do you establish what this
document is? It appears to be the report of M. Marc Toledano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is correct, Mr. President. This report, with
the rest of the documents in the same bundle, was incorporated in
the document presented by the French Office for Inquiry into
War Crimes, as is evident from the official signature of M.
Zambeaux on the original, which is in the hands of the Secretary
of the Court. I shall read the first page of the original:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I, the undersigned, Madame Bondoux, supervisor at the
prison in Bourges, certify that nine men, mostly youths, were
subjected to abominable treatment. They remained with
their hands bound behind their backs and with chains on
their feet for 15 to 20 days; it was absolutely impossible for
them to take their food in a normal way and they were
screaming with hunger. In the face of this situation several
of the ordinary criminal prisoners showed their willingness
to help these martyrs by making small packets from their
own rations which I had passed to them in the evening. A
certain German supervisor, whom I knew under his first
name of Michel, threw their bread in a corner of the cell,
and at night came to beat them. All these young men were
shot on 20 November 1943.</p>
<hr class='tbk275'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Then, too, a woman named Hartwig, who lived at Chevannes,
I believe, told me that she had remained for 4 days
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
bound to a chair. At all events, I can testify that her body
was completely bruised.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We read in the statement of M. Labussiere, who is a captain of
the reserve and a teacher at Marseilles-les-Aubigny:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the 11th I was twice flogged with a lash. I had to
bend over a bench and the muscles of my thighs and calves
were fully stretched. At first I received some 30 lashes with
a heavy whip, then another instrument was used which had
a buckle at the end. I then was struck on the buttocks, on
the thighs, and on the calves. To do this my torturer got
up on a bench and made me spread my legs. Then with a
very thin thong he finished off by giving me some 20 more
biting lashes. When I picked myself up I was dizzy and I
fell to the ground. I was always picked up again. Needless
to say, the handcuffs were never taken off my wrists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I recoil from reading the remainder of this testimony. The
details which precede are atrocious.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 10 o’clock on the 12th, after having beaten a woman,
Paoli came to find me and said: ‘Dog, you have no heart. It
was your wife I have just beaten. I’ll go on doing it as long
as you refuse to talk.’ He wanted me to give the place of our
meetings and the names of my comrades.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On the following line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the 14th at 6 o’clock in the evening I was taken once
again to the torture chamber. I could hardly crawl. Before he
let me come in, Paoli said: ‘I give you 5 minutes to tell me
all you know. If after these 5 minutes you’ve said nothing,
you’ll be shot at 3 o’clock; your wife will be shot at six, and
your boy will be sent to Germany.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We read that after signing the record of the interrogation his
torturer said to him:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Look at yourself! See what we can make of a man in
5 days! You haven’t seen the finish yet!’ And he added:
‘Now get out of here. You make us sick!’ ”—and the witness
concluded with—“I was, in fact, covered with filth from head
to foot. They put me in a cart and took me back to my
cell .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. During those 5 days I had certainly received more
than 700 strokes from a lash .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A large hematosis (blood clot) appeared on both his buttocks.
A doctor had to operate. His comrades in custody would not go
near him because of the foul smell from the abscesses covering his
body as a result of the ill-treatment. On 24 November, the date
on which he was interrogated, he had not yet recovered from
his wounds.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>His testimony concludes with a general statement of the
methods of torture which were used:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) The lash.</p>
<hr class='tbk276'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) The bath: The victim was plunged headfirst into a tub
full of cold water until he was asphyxiated. Then they
applied artificial respiration. If he would not talk they
repeated the process several times consecutively. With his
clothes soaking, he spent the night in a cold cell.</p>
<hr class='tbk277'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) Electric current: The terminals were placed on the hands,
then on the feet, in the ears, and then one in the anus and
another on the end of the penis.</p>
<hr class='tbk278'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4) Crushing the testicles in a press specially made for the
purpose. Twisting the testicles was frequent.</p>
<hr class='tbk279'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5) Hanging: The patient’s hands were handcuffed together
behind his back. A hook was slipped through his handcuffs
and the victim was lifted by a pulley. At first they
jerked him up and down. Later, they left him suspended for
varying, fairly long, periods. The arms were often dislocated.
In the camp I saw Lieutenant Lefevre, who, having
been suspended like that for more than 4 hours, had lost
the use of both arms.</p>
<hr class='tbk280'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6) Burning with a soldering lamp or with matches:</p>
<hr class='tbk281'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 2 July my comrade Laloue, a teacher from Cher, came
to the camp. He had been subjected to most of these tortures
at Bourges. One arm had been put out of joint and he was
unable to move the fingers of his right hand as a result of
the hanging. He had been subjected to flogging and electricity.
Sharp-pointed matches had been driven under the nails
of his hands and feet. His wrists and ankles had been
wrapped with rolls of wadding and the matches had been
set on fire. While they were burning, a German plunged a
pointed knife into the soles of his feet several times and
another lashed him with a whip. Phosphorous burns had
eaten away several fingers as far as the second joint.
Abscesses which had developed had burst and this saved
him from blood poisoning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Under the signature of one of the chiefs of the General Staff
of the French Forces of the Interior, who freed the Department of
Cher, M. Magnon—whose signature is authenticated by the French
official authorities whom you know—we read that since the
liberation of Bourges, 6 September 1944, an inspection of the
Gestapo cellars disclosed an instrument of torture, a bracelet
composed of several balls of hard wood with steel spikes. There
was a device for tightening the bracelet round the victim’s wrist.
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
This bracelet was seen by numerous soldiers and leaders of the
Maquis of Manetou-Salon. It was in the hands of Adjutant Neuilly,
now in the 1st Battalion of the 34th Demi-Brigade. A drawing is
attached to this declaration. Commander Magnon certifies having
seen the instrument described above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit Document F-565, from the military service of
the department of Vaucluse, which becomes Exhibit Number
RF-309. It is a repetition of the same methods. We do not consider
it necessary to dwell upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will now turn to Document F-567, which we submit as
Exhibit Number RF-310. It refers to the tortures practiced by the
German police in Besançon. It is a deposition of M. Dommergues,
a professor at Besançon. This deposition was received by the
American War Crimes Commission—the mission of Captain Miller.
We shall read about the statement of M. Dommergues, professor
at Besançon:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He was arrested on 11 February 1944; was violently struck
with a lash during the interrogation. When a woman who
was being tortured uttered screams, they made M. Dommergues
believe that it was his own wife. He saw a comrade
hung up with a weight of 50 kilograms on each foot.
Another had his eyes pierced with pins. A child lost its
voice completely.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is from the American War Crimes Commission, summing up
M. Dommergues’ deposition. This document includes a second part
under the same Number F-567(b). We shall read some excerpts
from this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One of the members has not got his document
marked, and I want to know whose statement it is you are
referring to. Is it Dr. Gomet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is not a statement; it is rather a letter sent by
Dr. Gomet, Secretary of the Council of the Departmental College
of Doubs of the National Order of Physicians. This letter was sent
by him to the chief medical officer of the Feldkommandantur in
Besançon on 11 September 1943. Here is the text of this letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Doctor and Colleague,</p>
<hr class='tbk282'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have the Honor to deliver to you the note which I drafted
at your request and sent to our colleagues of the department
in a circular of 1 September.</p>
<hr class='tbk283'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My conscience compels me on the other hand, to take up
another subject with you.</p>
<hr class='tbk284'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Quite recently I had to treat a Frenchman who had wounds
and multiple ecchymosis on his face and body, as a result
of the torture apparatus employed by the German security
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
service. He is a man of good standing, holding an important
appointment under the French Government; and he was
arrested because they thought he could furnish certain information.
They could make no accusation against him, as is
proved by the fact that he was freed in a few days, when
the interrogation to which they wanted to subject him was
finished.</p>
<hr class='tbk285'/>
<p class='noindent'>“He was subjected to torture, not as a legal penalty or in
legitimate defense; but for the sole purpose of forcing him
to speak under stress of violence and pain.</p>
<hr class='tbk286'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As for myself, representing the French medical body here,
my conscience and a strict conception of my duty compel
me to inform you of what I have observed in the exercise
of my profession. I appeal to your conscience as a doctor
and ask you whether by virtue of our mission of protecting
the physical health of our fellow-beings, which is the
mission of every doctor, it is not our duty to intervene.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He must have had a reply from the German doctor, for Dr.
Gomet writes him a second letter, and here is the text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Doctor and Colleague,</p>
<hr class='tbk287'/>
<p class='noindent'>“You were good enough to note the facts which I put before
you in my letter of 11 September 1943 regarding the torture
apparatus utilized by the German Security Service
during the interrogation of a French official for whom I had
subsequently to prescribe treatment. You asked me, as
was quite natural, if you could visit the person in question
yourself. I replied at our recent meeting that the person
concerned did not know of the step which I had taken; and
I did not know whether he would authorize me to give his
name. I wish to emphasize, in fact, that I myself am solely
responsible for this initiative. The person through whom
I learned, by virtue of my profession, the facts which I have
just related to you, had nothing to do with this report. The
question is strictly professional. My conscience as a doctor
has forced me to bring this matter to your attention. I
advance only what I know from absolutely certain observation,
and I guarantee the truth of my statement on my
honor as a man, a physician, and a Frenchman.</p>
<hr class='tbk288'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My patient was interrogated twice by the German Security
Service about the end of August 1943. I had to examine him
on 8 September 1943, that is to say, about 10 days after he
left prison, where he had in vain asked for medical attention.
He had a palpebral ecchymosis on the left side and abrasions
in the region of his right temple, which he said were made
with a sort of circle which they had placed upon his head
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
and which they struck with small clubs. He had ecchymosis
on the backs of his hands, these having been placed,
according to what he told me, in a squeezing apparatus. On
the front of his legs there were still scars with scabs and
small surface wounds—the result, he told me, of blows
administered with flexible rods studded with short spikes.</p>
<hr class='tbk289'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Obviously, I cannot swear to the means by which the
ecchymosis and wounds were produced, but I note that
their appearance is in complete agreement with the explanations
given me.</p>
<hr class='tbk290'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It will be easy for you, Sir, to learn if apparatus of the
kind to which I allude is really in use in the German
Security Service.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I pass over the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It may be convenient for counsel and
others to know that the Tribunal will not sit in open session
tomorrow, as it has many administrative matters to consider. We
will adjourn now until 2 o’clock.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: If Your Honors please, the Defendants Kaltenbrunner
and Streicher will continue to be absent this afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We left off this morning at the enumeration of the
tortures that had been practiced habitually by the Gestapo in the
various cities in France where inquiries had been conducted; and
I was proving to you, by reading numerous documents, that everywhere
accused persons and frequently witnesses themselves—as seen
in the last letter—were questioned with brutality and subjected to
tortures that were usually identical. This systematic repetition of
the same methods of torture proves, we believe, that a common plan
existed, conceived by the German Government itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We still have a great many testimonies, all extracts from the
report of the American services, concerning the prisons at Dreux,
at Morlaix, and at Metz. These testimonies are given in Documents
F-689, 690, and 691, which we now submit as Exhibits RF-311, 312,
and 313.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With your permission, Your Honor, I will now refrain from
further citing these documents. The same acts were systematically
repeated. This is also true of the tortures inflicted in Metz, Cahors,
Marseilles, and Quimperlé, dealt with in Documents F-692, 693, 565,
and 694, which we are presenting to you as Exhibits RF-314, 314
(bis), 309, and 315.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to one of the most odious crimes committed by the
Gestapo, and it is not possible for us to keep silent about it in spite
of our desire to shorten this statement. This is the murder of a
French officer by the Gestapo at Clermont-Ferrand, a murder which
was committed under extremely shameful conditions, in contempt
of all the rules of international law; for it was perpetrated in a
region where, according to the terms of the Armistice, the Gestapo
had nothing to do and had no right to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name of this French officer was Major Henri Madeline. His
case is given in Document F-575, which we submit as Exhibit Number
RF-316. He was arrested on 1 October 1943 at Vichy. His interrogation
began in January 1944; and he was struck in such a savage
manner, in the course of the first interrogation, that when he was
brought back to his cell his hand was already broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 January this officer was questioned again on two occasions,
during which he was struck so violently that when he returned
to his cell his hands were so swollen that it was impossible to see
the handcuffs he had on. The following day the German police came
back to fetch him from his cell, where he had passed the whole night
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
in agony. He was still alive; they threw him down on a road a kilometer
away from a small village in the Massif Central, Perignant-Les-Sarlièves,
to make it look as if he had been the victim of a road
accident. His body was found later. A post mortem showed that the
thorax was completely crushed, with multiple fractures of the ribs
and perforation of the lungs. There was also dislocation of the
spine, fracture of the lower jaw, and most of the tissues of the head
were loose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, we all know that a few French traitors did assist in the
arrests and in the misdeeds of the Gestapo in France under the
orders of German officers. One of these traitors, who was arrested
when our country was liberated, has described the ill-treatment
that had been inflicted on Major Madeline. The name of this traitor
is Verière and we are going to read a passage from his statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He was beaten with a whip and a bludgeon; blows on his
fingernails crushed his fingers. He was forced to walk barefooted
on tacks. He was burned with cigarettes. Finally, he
was beaten unmercifully and taken back to his cell in a dying
condition.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Major Madeline was not the only victim of such evil treatment
which several German officers of the Gestapo helped to inflict. This
inquiry has shown:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that 12 known persons succumbed to the tortures inflicted
by the Gestapo of Clermont-Ferrand, that some women were
stripped naked and beaten before they were raped.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am anxious not to lengthen these proceedings by useless citations.
I believe the Tribunal will consider as confirmed the facts
that I have presented. They are contained in the document that we
are placing before you, and in it the Tribunal will find, in extenso,
the written testimonies taken on the day which followed the liberation.
This systematic repetition of the same criminal proceedings
in order to achieve the same purpose—to bring about a reign of
terror—was not the isolated act of a subordinate having authority
in our country only and remaining outside the control of his
government or of the Army General Staff. An examination of the
methods of the German police in all countries of the West shows
that the same horrors, the same atrocities, were repeated systematically
everywhere. Whether in Denmark, Belgium, Holland, or
Norway, the interrogations were everywhere and at all times conducted
by the Gestapo with the same savagery, the same contempt
of the rights of self defense, the same contempt of human dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Denmark, we cite a few lines from a document
already submitted to the Tribunal. It is Document F-666 (Exhibit
Number RF-317), which should be the sixth in your document book.
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
It contains an official Danish report of October 1945, concerning the
German major war criminals appearing before the International
Military Tribunal. On Page 5, under the title, “Torture”, we read
in a brief résumé everything that concerns the question with regard
to Denmark:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In numerous cases the German police and their assistants
used torture in order to force the prisoners to confess or to
give information. This fact is supported by irrefutable evidence.
In most cases the torture consisted of beating with a
rod or with a rubber bludgeon. But also far more flagrant
forms of torture were used including some which will leave
lasting injuries. Bovensiepen has stated that the order to use
torture in certain cases emanated from higher authorities, possibly
even from Göring as Chief of the Geheime Staatspolizei
but, at any rate, from Heydrich. The instructions were to the
effect that torture might be used to compel persons to give
information that might serve to disclose subversive organizations
directed against the German Reich, but not for the
purpose of making the delinquent admit his own deeds.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A little further on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The means were prescribed, namely, a limited number of
strokes with a rod. Bovensiepen does not remember whether
the maximum limit was 10 or 20 strokes. An officer from
the criminal police (Kriminal Kommissar, Kriminalrat) was
there and also, when circumstances so required, there was a
medical officer present.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The above-mentioned instructions were modified several times for
minor details, and all members of the criminal police were notified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Danish Government points out, in conclusion, two particularly
repugnant cases of torture inflicted on Danish patriots. They
are the cases of Professor Mogens Fog and the ill-treatment inflicted
on Colonel Ejnar Thiemroth. Finally, the Tribunal can read that
Doctor Hoffmann-Best states that his official prerogatives did not
authorize him to prevent the use of torture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Belgium we should recall first of all the tortures
that were inflicted in the tragically famous camp of Breendonck,
where hundreds, even thousands of Belgian patriots, were shut up.
We shall revert to Breendonck when we deal with the question of
concentration camps. We shall merely quote from the report of the
Belgian War Crimes Commission a few definite facts in support
of our original affirmation, that all acts of ill-treatment imputed to
the Gestapo in France were reproduced in identical manner in all
the occupied western countries. The documents which we shall
submit to you are to be found in the small document book under
Numbers F-942(a), 942(b), Exhibits RF-318, 319.
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This report comprises minutes which I will not read, inasmuch
as it contains testimonies which are analogous to, if not identical
with, those that were read concerning France. However, on Pages 1
and 2 you will find the statement made by M. Auguste Ramasl and
a statement made by M. Paul Desomer, which show that the most
extreme cruelties were inflicted on these men and that, when they
emerged from the offices of the Gestapo, they were completely disfigured
and unable to stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I submit to you with regard to Belgium, Documents
F-641(a) and F-641(b), which now become Exhibits RF-320 and 321.
I shall not read them. They, too, contain reports describing tortures
similar to those I have already mentioned. If the Court will accept
the cruelty of the methods of torture employed by the Gestapo as
having been established, I will abstain from reading all the testimonies
which have been collected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Norway our information is taken from a document
submitted by the Norwegian Government for the punishment of
the major war criminals. In the French translation of this document—Number
UK-79, which we present as Exhibit Number RF-323—on
Page 2, the Tribunal will find the statement of the Norwegian
Government according to which numerous Norwegian citizens died
from the cruel treatment inflicted on them during their interrogations.
The number of known cases for the district of Oslo, only,
is 52; but the number in the various regions of Norway is undoubtedly
much higher. The total number of Norwegian citizens
who died during the occupation in consequence of torture or ill-treatment,
execution, or suicide in political prisons or concentration
camps is approximately 2,100.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Paragraph B, Page 2 of the document, there is a description
of the methods employed in the services of the Gestapo in Norway
which were identical with those I have already described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Holland, we shall submit Document Number F-224,
which becomes Exhibit Number RF-324 and which, is an extract
from the statement of the Dutch Government for the prosecution
and punishment of the major German war criminals. This document
bears the date of 11 January 1946. It has been distributed and
should now be in your hands. The Tribunal will find in this document
a great number of testimonies which were collected by the
Criminal Investigation Department, all of which describe the same
ill-treatment and tortures as those already known to you and which
were committed by the services of the Gestapo in Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland, as elsewhere, the accused were struck with sticks.
When their backs were completely raw from beating they were sent
back to their cells. Sometimes icy water was sprayed on them and
sometimes they were exposed to electrical current. At Amersfoort
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
a witness saw with his own eyes a prisoner, who was a priest,
beaten to death with a rubber truncheon. The systematic character
of such tortures seems to me definitely established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document of the Danish Government is a first proof in support
of my contention that these systematic tortures were deliberately
willed by the higher authorities of the Reich and that the members
of the German Government are responsible for them. In any
case these systematic tortures were certainly known, because there
were protests from all European countries against such methods,
which plunged us again into the darkness of the Middle Ages; and
at no time was an order given to forbid such methods, at no time
were those who executed them repudiated by their superiors. The
methods followed were devised to reinforce the policy of terrorism
pursued by Germany in the western occupied countries—a policy of
terrorism which I already described to you when I dealt with the
question of hostages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is now incumbent on me to designate to you by name those
among the accused whom France, as well as other countries in the
West, considers to be especially guilty in having prepared and
developed this criminal policy carried out by the Gestapo. We
maintain that they are Bormann and Kaltenbrunner who, because
of their functions, must have known more than any others, about
those deeds. Although we are not in possession of any document
signed by them in respect to the western countries, the uniformity
of the acts we have described to you and the fact that they were
analogous and even identical, in spite of the diversity of places,
enables us to assert that all these orders were dictated by a single
will; and among the accused, Bormann and Kaltenbrunner were the
direct instruments of that single will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything I described to you here concerned the procedure
prior to judgment. We know with what ferocity this procedure was
applied. We know that this ferocity was intentional. It was known
to the populations of the invaded countries, and its purpose was to
create an atmosphere of real terror around the Gestapo and all the
German police services.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the examination came the judicial proceedings. These
proceedings were, as we see them, only a parody of justice. The
prosecution was based on a legal concept which we dismiss as being
absolutely inhuman. That part will be dealt with by my colleague,
M. Edgar Faure, in the second part of the statement on the German
atrocities in the western countries: crimes against the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is sufficient for us to know that the German courts which dealt
with crimes committed by the citizens of the occupied western
countries, which did not accept defeat, never applied but one penalty,
the death penalty, and that in execution of an inhuman order by
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
one of these men, Keitel; an order which appears in Document Number
L-90, already submitted to you by my United States colleagues,
under Document Number USA-503. It is the penultimate in your
large document book, Line 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If these offenses are punished with imprisonment or even
with hard labor for life, it will be interpreted as a sign of
weakness. Effective and lasting intimidation can only be
achieved either by capital punishment or by measures which
leave the relatives and the population in the dark about the
fate of the culprit. Deportation to Germany serves this purpose.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is it necessary to make any comment? Can we be surprised at
this war leader giving orders to justice? What we heard about him
yesterday makes us doubt that he is merely a military leader. We
have quoted you his own words, “Effective and lasting intimidation
can only be achieved by capital punishment.” Are such orders, given
to courts of justice, compatible with military honor? “If in effect”—Keitel
goes on to say in this Document—“the courts are unable to
pronounce the death penalty, then the man must be deported.” I
think you will share my opinion that, when such orders are given
to courts, one can no longer speak of justice. In execution of this
order, those of our compatriots who were not condemned to death
and immediately executed were deported to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the third part of my statement: the question of
deportation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It remains for me to explain to you in what circumstances the
deportations were carried out. If prior to that the Tribunal could
suspend the sitting for a few minutes, I should be very grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How long would you like us to suspend,
M. Dubost?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Perhaps ten minutes, Your Honor.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO NELTE (Counsel for the Defendant Keitel): The
French Prosecutor just now read from Document L-90, the so-called
“Nacht und Nebel” decree. He referred to this decree and cited the
words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Effective and lasting intimidation can only be achieved by
capital punishment, or by measures which leave the relatives
and the population in the dark about the fate of the culprit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The French Prosecutor mentioned that these were the very words
of Keitel.
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with a previous case the President and the Tribunal
have pointed out that it is not permissible to quote only a
part of a document when by so doing a wrong impression might
be created. The French Prosecutor will agree with me when I say
that Decree L-90 makes it quite clear that these are not the words
of the Chief of the OKW, but of Hitler. In this short extract it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the carefully considered will of the Führer that, when
attacks are made in occupied countries against the Reich or
against the occupying power, the culprits must be dealt with
by other measures than those decreed heretofore. The Führer
is of the opinion that if these offenses are punished with
imprisonment, or even with hard labor for life, this will be
looked upon as a sign of weakness. Effective and lasting
intimidation can only be achieved by capital punishment,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The decree then goes on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The enclosed directives on how to deal with the offences
comply with the Führer’s point of view. They have been
examined and approved by him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I take the liberty to point out this fact, because it was just this
decree, which is known as the notorious “Nacht und Nebel” decree,
which in its formulation and execution was opposed by Keitel.
That is why I am protesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I owe you an explanation. I did not read the
decree in full because the Tribunal knows it. In accordance with
the customary procedure of this Tribunal, it has been read. It is
not necessary to read it again. Moreover, I knew that the accused
Keitel had signed it, but that Hitler had conceived it. Therefore,
I made allusion to the military honor of this general, who was not
afraid to become the lackey of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal understood from your mentioning
of the fact that the document had already been submitted
to the Tribunal and does not think that there was anything misleading
in what you did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If the Tribunal accepts this, we shall proceed to
the hearing of a witness, a Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Lampe, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is your witness, is it not? Is this the
witness you wish to call?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To the witness</span>] Will you stand up. What
is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. MAURICE LAMPE (Witness): Lampe, Maurice.
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: Do you
swear to speak without hate or fear, to say the truth, all the truth,
only the truth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raise the right hand and say, I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Spell your name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: L-A-M-P-E.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were born in Roubaix on the 23rd of August
1900. Were you deported by the Germans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were interned in Mauthausen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you testify as to what you know concerning
this internment camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Willingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Say what you know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I was arrested on 8 November 1941. After two years
and a half of internment in France, I was deported on 22 March
1944 to Mauthausen in Austria. The journey lasted three days and
three nights under particularly vile conditions—104 deportees in a
cattle truck without air. I do not believe that it is necessary to give
all the details of this journey, but one can well imagine the state
in which we arrived at Mauthausen on the morning of the 25th of
March 1944, in weather 12 degrees below zero. I mention, however,
that from the French border we traveled in the trucks, naked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we arrived at Mauthausen, the SS officer who received
this convoy of about 1,200 Frenchmen informed us in the following
words, which I shall quote from memory almost word for word:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany needs your arms. You are, therefore, going to
work; but I want to tell you that you will never see your
families again. When one enters this camp, one leaves it by
the chimney of the crematorium.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I remained about three weeks in quarantine in an isolated block,
and I was then detailed to work with a squad in a stone quarry.
The quarry at Mauthausen was in a hollow about 800 metres from
the camp proper. There were 186 steps down to it. It was particularly
painful torture, because the steps were so rough-hewn that
to climb them even without a load was extremely tiring.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, 15 April 1944, I was detailed to a team of 12 men—all
of them French—under the orders of a German “Kapo,” a common
criminal, and of an SS man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We started work at seven o’clock in the morning. By eight
o’clock, one hour later, two of my comrades had already been
murdered. They were an elderly man, M. Gregoire from Lyons,
and a quite young man, Lefevre from Tours. They were murdered
because they had not understood the order, given in German,
detailing them for a task. We were very frequently beaten because
of our inability to understand the German language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of that first day, 15 April 1944, we were told to
carry the two corpses to the top, and the one that I, with three of
my comrades, carried was that of old Gregoire, a very heavy man;
we had to go up 186 steps with a corpse and we all received blows
before we reached the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life in Mauthausen—and I shall declare before this Tribunal
only what I myself saw and experienced—was a long cycle of torture
and of suffering. However, I would like to recall a few scenes
which were particularly horrible and have remained more firmly
fixed in my memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During September, I think it was on the 6th of September 1944,
there came to Mauthausen a small convoy of 47 British, American,
and Dutch officers. They were airmen who had come down by
parachute. They had been arrested after having tried to make
their way back to their own lines. Because of this they were condemned
to death by a German tribunal. They had been in prison
about a year and a half and were brought to Mauthausen for execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On their arrival they were transferred to the bunker, the camp
prison. They were made to undress and had only their pants and a
shirt. They were barefooted. The following morning they were at
the roll call at seven o’clock. The work gangs went to their tasks.
The 47 officers were assembled in front of the office and were told
by the commanding officer of the camp that they were all under
sentence of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must mention that one of the American officers asked the commander
that he should be allowed to meet his death as a soldier.
In reply, he was bashed with a whip. The 47 were led barefoot to
the quarry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all the prisoners at Mauthausen the murder of these men
has remained in their minds like a scene from Dante’s Inferno.
This is how it was done: At the bottom of the steps they loaded
stone on the backs of these poor men and they had to carry them
to the top. The first journey was made with stones weighing 25 to
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
30 kilos and was accompanied by blows. Then they were made to
run down. For the second journey the stones were still heavier;
and whenever the poor wretches sank under their burden, they
were kicked and hit with a bludgeon, even stones were hurled
at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This went on for several days. In the evening when I returned
from the gang with which I was then working, the road which led to
the camp was a bath of blood. I almost stepped on the lower jaw
of a man. Twenty-one bodies were strewn along the road. Twenty-one
had died on the first day. The twenty-six others died the following
morning. I have tried to make my account of this horrible
episode as short as possible. We were not able, at least when we
were in camp, to find out the names of these officers; but I think
that by now their names must have been established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September 1944 Himmler visited us. Nothing was changed in
the camp routine. The work gangs went to their tasks as usual, and
I had—we had—the unhappy opportunity of seeing Himmler close.
If I mention Himmler’s visit to the camp—after all it was not a
great event—it is because that day they presented to Himmler the
execution of fifty Soviet officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must tell you that I was then working in a Messerschmidt
gang, and that day I was on night shift. The block where I was
billeted was just opposite the crematorium; and in the execution
room, we saw—I saw—these Soviet officers lined up in rows of five
in front of my block. They were called one by one. The way to the
execution room was relatively short. It was reached by a stairway.
The execution room was under the crematorium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The execution, which Himmler himself witnessed—at least the
beginning of it, because it lasted throughout the afternoon—was
another particularly horrible spectacle. I repeat, the Soviet Army
officers were called one by one, and there was a sort of human chain
between the group which was awaiting its turn and that which was
in the stairway listening to the shots which killed their predecessors.
They were all killed by a shot in the neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You witnessed this personally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I repeat that on that afternoon I was in Block 11, which
was situated opposite the crematorium; and although we did not
see the execution itself, we heard every shot; and we saw the condemned
men who were waiting on the stairway opposite us embrace
each other before they parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who were these men who were condemned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: The majority of them were Soviet officers, political
commissars, or members of the Bolshevik Party. They came from
Oflags.
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I beg your pardon, but were there officers among
them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you know where they came from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: It was very difficult to know from what camp they
came because, as a general rule, they were isolated when they
arrived in camp. They were taken either direct to the prison or
else to Block 20, which was an annex of the prison, about which
I shall have occasion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How did you know they were officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Because we were able to communicate with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did all of them come from prisoner-of-war camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Probably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You did not really know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: No, we did not know. We were chiefly interested in
finding out of what nationality they were and did not ask other
details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know where the British, American, and
Dutch officers came from, about whom you have just spoken and
who were executed on the steps leading to the quarry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I believe they came from the Netherlands, especially
the Air Force officers. They had probably bailed out after having
been shot down and had hidden themselves while trying to go back
to their lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did the Mauthausen prisoners know that prisoners
of war, officers or noncommissioned officers, were executed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: That was a frequent occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: A frequent occurrence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes, very frequent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know about any mass executions of the
men kept at Mauthausen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I know of many instances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Could you cite a few?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Besides those I have already described, I feel I ought
to mention what happened to part of a convoy coming from Sachsenhausen
which was executed by a special method. This was on
17 February 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Allied armies were advancing, various camps were
moved back toward Austria. Of a convoy of 2,500 internees which
had left Sachsenhausen, only about 1,700 were left when they arrived
at Mauthausen on the morning of the 17th of February. 800 had
died or had been killed in the course of the journey.
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mauthausen Camp was at that time, if I may use this
expression, completely choked. So when the 1,700 survivors of this
convoy arrived, Kommandant Dachmeier had selected 400 from
among them. He encouraged the sick, the old, and the weak prisoners
to come forward with the idea that they might be taken to
the infirmary. These 400 men, who had either come forward of
their own free will or had been arbitrarily selected, were stripped
entirely naked and left for 18 hours in weather 18 degrees below
zero, between the laundry building and the wall of the camp. The
congestion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You saw that yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I saw it personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are citing this as an actual witness, seen with
your own eyes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In what part of the camp were you at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: This scene lasted, as I said, 18 hours; and when we
went in or came out of the camp we saw these unfortunate men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Very well. Will you please continue? You have
spoken of the visit of Himmler and of the execution of Soviet officers
and commissars. Did you frequently see German personalities
in the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes, but I cannot give you the names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You did not know them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: One could hardly mistake Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: But you did know they were eminent personalities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: We did indeed. First of all, these personages were
always surrounded by a complete staff, who went through the
prison itself and particularly adjoining blocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you will allow me, I would like to go on with my description
of the murder of these 400 people from Sachsenhausen. I said that
after selecting the sick, the feeble and the older prisoners, Dachmeier,
the camp commander, gave orders that these men should be
stripped entirely naked in weather 18 degrees below zero. Several
of them rapidly got congestion of the lungs, but that did not seem
fast enough for the SS. Three times during the night these men
were sent down to the shower-baths; three times they were drenched
for half an hour in freezing water and then made to come up
without being dried. In the morning when the gangs went to work
the corpses were strewn over the ground. I must add that the last
of them were finished off with blows from an axe.
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now give the most positive testimony of an occurrence which
can easily be verified. Among those 400 men was a captain in the
French cavalry, Captain Dedionne, who today is a major in the
Ministry of War. This captain was among the 400. He owes his
life to the fact that he hid among the corpses and thus escaped the
blows of the axe. When the corpses were taken to the crematorium
he managed to get away across the camp, but not without having
received a blow on the shoulder which has left a mark for life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was caught again by the SS. What saved him was probably
the fact that the SS considered it very funny that a live man should
emerge from a heap of corpses. We took care of him, we helped
him, and we brought him back to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know why this execution was carried out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Because there were too many people in the camp;
because the prisoners coming from all the camps that were falling
back could not be drafted into working gangs at a quick enough
pace. The blocks were overcrowded. That is the only explanation
that was given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know who gave the order to exterminate
the British, American, and Dutch officers whom you saw put to
death in the quarry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I believe I said these officers had been condemned to
death by German tribunals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Probably a few of them had been condemned many
months before and they were taken to Mauthausen for the sentence
to be carried out. It is probable that the order came from Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you know under what conditions the “Revier”
(infirmary) was built?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Here I have to state that the infirmary was built before
my arrival at the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: So you are giving us indirect testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes, indirect testimony. But I heard it from all the
internees, also the SS themselves. The Revier was built by the first
Soviet prisoners who arrived in Mauthausen. Four thousand Soviet
soldiers died; they were murdered, massacred, during the construction
of the 8 blocks of the Revier. These massacres made such a
deep impression that the Revier was always referred to as the
“Russen Lager” (Russian Camp). The SS themselves called the
infirmary the Russian camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many Frenchmen were you at Mauthausen?
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: There were in Mauthausen and its dependencies about
10,000 Frenchmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many of you came back?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Three thousand of us came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: There were some Spaniards with you also?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Eight thousand Spaniards arrived in Mauthausen in
1941, towards the end of the year. When we left, at the end of
April 1945, there were still about 1,600. All the rest had been
exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Where did these Spaniards come from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: These Spaniards came mostly from labor companies
which had been formed in 1939 and 1940 in France, or else they had
been delivered by the Vichy Government to the Germans direct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is this all you have to tell us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: With the permission of the Tribunal, I would like to
cite another example of atrocity which remains clearly in my
memory. This took place also during September 1944. I am sorry
I cannot remember the exact date, but I do know it was a Saturday,
because on Saturday at Mauthausen all the outside detachments
had to answer evening roll call inside the camp. That took place
only on Saturday nights and on Sunday mornings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening the roll call took longer than usual. Someone was
missing. After a long wait and searches carried out in the various
blocks, they found a Russian, a Soviet prisoner, who perhaps had
fallen asleep and had forgotten to answer roll call. What the reason
was we never knew, but at any rate he was not present at roll call.
Immediately the dogs and the SS went up to the poor wretch, and
before the whole camp—I was in the front row, not because I
wanted to be but because we were arranged like that—we witnessed
the fury of the dogs let loose upon this unfortunate Russian. He
was tom to pieces in the presence of the whole camp. I must add
that this man, in spite of his sufferings, faced his death in a
particularly noble manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What were the living conditions of the prisoners
like? Were they all treated the same or were they treated differently
according to their origin and nationality or, perhaps according to
their ethnic type, their particular race, shall we say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: As a general rule the camp regime was the same for
all nationalities, with the exception of the quarantine blocks and
the annexes of the prison. The kind of work we did, the particular
units to which we were attached, sometimes allowed us to get a
little more than usual; for instance, those who worked in the
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
kitchens and those who worked in the stores certainly did get a
little more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were, for instance, Jews permitted to work in the
kitchens or the store rooms?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: At Mauthausen the Jews had the hardest tasks of all.
I must point out that, until December 1943, the Jews did not live
more than three months at Mauthausen. There were very few of
them at the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What happened in that camp after the murder of
Heydrich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: In that connection there was a particularly dramatic
episode. At Mauthausen there were 3,000 Czechs, 600 of whom were
intellectuals. After the murder of Heydrich, the Czech colony in the
camp was exterminated with the exception of 300 out of the 3,000
and six intellectuals out of the 600 that were in the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did anyone speak to you of scientific experiments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: They were commonplace at Mauthausen, as they were
in other camps. But we had evidence which I think has been found:
the two skulls which were used as paper weights by the chief SS
medical officer. These were the skulls of two young Dutch Jews
who had been selected from a convoy of 800 because they had fine
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To make this selection the SS doctor had led these two young
Dutch Jews to believe that they would not suffer the fate of their
comrades of the convoy. He had said to them “Jews do not live
here. I need two strong, healthy, young men for surgical experiments.
You have your choice; either you offer yourselves for these
experiments, or else you will suffer the fate of the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two Jews were taken down to the Revier; one of them
had his kidney removed, the other his stomach. Then they had
benzine injected into the heart and were decapitated. As I said,
these two skulls, with the fine sets of teeth, were on the desk of
the chief SS doctor on the day of liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: At the time of Himmler’s visit—I would like to
come back to that question—are you certain that you recognized
Himmler and saw him presiding over the executions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you think that all members of the German
Government were unaware of what was taking place in Mauthausen?
The visits you received, were they visits by the SS simply,
or were they visits of other personalities?
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: As regards your first question, we all knew Himmler;
and even if we had not known him, everyone in the camp knew
of his visit. Also the SS told us a few days before that his visit
was expected. Himmler was present at the beginning of the executions
of the Soviet officers; but as I said a little while ago, these
executions lasted throughout the afternoon; and he did not remain
until the end. With regard to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is it possible that only the SS knew what happened
in the camp? Was the camp visited by other personalities
than the SS? Did you know the SS uniforms? The people you saw,
the authorities you saw—did they all wear uniforms?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: The personalities that we saw at the camp were,
generally speaking, soldiers and officers. Some time afterward, a
few weeks before the liberation, we had a visit from the Gauleiter
of the Gau Oberdonau. We also had frequent visits from members
of the Gestapo in plain clothes. The German population, that is,
the Austrian population, were perfectly aware of what was going
on at Mauthausen. The working squads were nearly all for work
outside. I said just now that I was working at Messerschmidt’s. The
foremen were mobilized German civilians who, in the evening,
went home to their families. They knew quite well of our sufferings
and privations. They frequently saw men fetched from the
shop to be executed, and they could bear witness to most of the
massacres I mentioned a little while ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should add that once we received—I am sorry I put it like
that—once there arrived in Mauthausen 30 firemen from Vienna.
They were imprisoned, I think, for having taken part in some sort
of workers’ activity. The firemen from Vienna told us that, when
one wanted to frighten children in Vienna, one said to them, “If you
are not good, I will send you to Mauthausen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another detail, a more concrete one: Mauthausen Camp is built
on a plateau and every night the chimneys of the crematorium
would light up the whole district, and everyone knew what the
crematorium was for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another detail: The town of Mauthausen was situated 5 kilometers
from the camp. The convoys of deportees were brought to
the station of the town. The whole population could see these
convoys pass. The whole population knew in what state these
convoys were brought into the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the Soviet Prosecutor wish to ask any
questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GENERAL R. A. RUDENKO (Chief Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.):
I should like to ask a few questions. Can you tell me, Witness, why
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
was the execution of the 50 Soviet officers ordered? Why were
they executed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: As regards the specific case of these 50 officers, I do
not know the reasons why they were condemned and executed;
but as a general rule, all Soviet officers, all Soviet commissars, or
members of the Bolshevist Party were executed at Mauthausen.
If a few among them succeeded in slipping through, it is because
their records were not known to the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You affirm that Himmler was present at the
execution of those 50 Soviet officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I testify to the fact because I saw him with my own eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Can you give us more precise details about
the execution of the 4,000 Soviet prisoners of war which you have
just mentioned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I cannot add much to what I have said, except that
these men were assassinated on the job probably because the work
demanded of them was beyond their strength and they were too
underfed to perform these tasks. They were murdered on the spot
by blows with a cudgel or struck down by the SS; they were driven
by the SS to the wire fence and shot down by the sentinels in
the watch towers. I cannot give more details because, as I said,
I was not a witness, an eyewitness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That is quite clear. And now one more
question: Can you give me a more detailed statement concerning
the destruction of the Czech colony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: I speak with the same reservation as before. I was
not in the camp at the time of the extermination of the 3,000
Czechs; but the survivors with whom I spoke in 1944 were unanimous
in confirming the accuracy of these facts, and probably, as
far as their own country is concerned, have drawn up a list of the
murdered men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: This means, if I have understood you correctly,
that in the camp where you were interned executions were
carried out without trial or inquiry. Every member of the SS had
the right to kill an internee. Have I understood your statement
correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes, that is so. The life of a man at Mauthausen
counted for absolutely nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any member of the defendants’ counsel
wish to ask any questions of this witness? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then the witness
can retire. Witness, a moment.
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Francis Biddle): Do you know how many
guards there were at the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: The number of the guard varied, but as a general rule
there were 1,200 SS and soldiers of the Volkssturm. However, it
should be said that only 50 to 60 SS were authorized to come
inside the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Were they SS men that were
authorized to go into the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: Yes, they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): All SS men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LAMPE: All of them were SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you. With your permission, gentlemen, we
shall proceed with the presentation of our case on German atrocities
in the western countries of Europe from 1939 to 1945 by retaining
from these testimonies the particular facts, which all equally constitute
crimes against common law. The general idea, around which
we have grouped all our work and our statement, is that of German
terror intentionally conceived as an instrument for governing all
the enslaved peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall remember the testimony brought by this French witness
who said that in Vienna, when one wished to frighten a child,
one told it about Mauthausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people who were arrested in the western countries were
deported to Germany where they were put into camps or into prisons.
The information that we have concerning the prisons has been
taken from the official report of the Prisoners of War Ministry,
which we have already read; it is the bound volume which was in
your hands this morning. In it you will find, on Page 35, and
Page 36 to Page 42, a detailed statement as to what the prisons
were like in Germany. The prison at Cologne is situated between
the freight station and the main station and the Chief Prosecutor
in Cologne, in a report .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: F-274?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Your Honor, F-274, on Page 35. The Document
was submitted under Exhibit Number RF-301. The Tribunal
will see that the prison at Cologne, where many Frenchmen were
interned, was situated between the freight station and the main
station so that the Chief Prosecutor in Cologne wrote, in a report
which was used by the Ministry of Deportees and Prisoners of War
when compiling the book which is before you, that the situation of
that prison was so dangerous that no enterprise engaged in war
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
work would undertake to furnish its precious materials to a factory
in this area. The prisoners could not take shelter during the air
attacks. They remained locked in their cells, even in case of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victims of air attacks in the prisons were numerous. The
May 1944 raid claimed 200 victims in the prison at Alexander Platz
in Berlin. At Aachen the buildings were always dirty, damp, and
very small; and the prisoners numbered three or four times as many
as the facilities permitted. In the Münster prison the women who
were there in November 1943 lived underground without any air.
In Frankfurt the prisoners had as cells a sort of iron cage, 2 by
1.5 meters. Hygiene was impossible. At Aachen, as in many other
prisons, the prisoners had only one bucket in the middle of the
room, and it was forbidden to empty it during the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The food ration was extremely small. As a rule, ersatz coffee
in the morning with a thin slice of bread; soup at noon; a thin slice
of bread at night with a little margarine or sausage or jam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners were forced to do extremely heavy work in war
industries, in food factories, in spinning mills. No matter what kind
of work it was, at least twelve hours of labor were required—at
Cologne, in particular, from 7 o’clock in the morning to 9 or 10 o’clock
in the evening, that is to say, 14 or 15 consecutive hours. I am still
quoting from the file of the Public Prosecutor of Cologne, a document,
Number 87, sent to us by the Ministry of Prisoners. A shoe
factory gave work to the inmates of 18 German prisons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I quote
from the same document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Most of the French flatly refused to work in war industries,
for example, the manufacture of gas masks, filing of cast iron
plates, slides for shells, radio or telephone apparatus intended
for the Army. In such cases Berlin gave orders for the recalcitrants
to be sent to punishment camps. An example of this
was the sending of women from Kottbus to Ravensbrück on
13 November 1944. The Geneva Convention was, of course,
not applied.</p>
<hr class='tbk291'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The political prisoners frequently had to remove unexploded
bombs.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is the official German text of the Public Prosecutor of Cologne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no medical supervision. There were no prophylactic
measures taken in these prisons in case of epidemics, or else the SS
doctor intentionally gave the wrong instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the prison of Dietz-an-der-Lahn, under the eyes of the director,
Gammradt, a former medical officer in the German Army, the
SS or SA guards struck the prisoners. Dysentery, diphtheria, pulmonary
diseases, and pleurisy were not reasons for stopping work;
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
and those who were dangerously ill were forced to work to the
very limit of their strength and were only admitted to the hospital
in exceptional cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many petty persecutions. In Aachen the presence of
a Jewish woman prisoner in a cell caused the other prisoners to lose
half of their ration. At Amrasch they had to go to toilets only when
ordered. At Magdeburg recalcitrants had to make one hundred
genuflexions before the guards. Interrogations were carried out in
the same manner as in France, that is, the victims were brutally
treated and were given practically no food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Asperg the doctor had heart injections given to the prisoners
so that they died. At Cologne those condemned to death were perpetually
kept in chains. At Sonnenburg those who were dying were
given a greenish liquor to drink which hastened their death. In
Hamburg sick Jews were forced to dig their own graves until,
exhausted, they fell into them. We are still speaking of French,
Belgians, Dutch, Luxembourgers, Danes, or Norwegians interned in
German prisons. These descriptions apply only to citizens of those
countries. In the Börse prison in Berlin, Jewish babies were massacred
before the eyes of their mothers. The sterilization of men is
confirmed by German documents in the file of the Prosecutor of
Cologne, which contains a ruling to the effect that the victims
cannot be reinstated in their military rights. These files also contain
documents which show the role played by children who were in
prison. They had to work inside the prison. A German functionary
belonging to the prison service inquired as to the decision to be
taken with regard to a 4-month-old baby, which was brought to the
prison at the same time as its father and mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What kind of people were the prison staff? They were “recruited
amongst the NSKK (National Socialist Motor Corps) and the SA
because of their political views and because they were above suspicion
and accustomed to harsh discipline.” This is also to be found
in the file of the Public Prosecutor at Cologne, Page 39, last paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Rheinbach those condemned to death and to be executed in
Cologne were beaten to death for breaches of discipline. We can
easily imagine the brutality of the men who were in charge of the
prisoners. The German official text will furnish us with details
regarding the executions. The condemned were guillotined. Nearly
all the condemned showed surprise, so say the German documents
of which we are giving you a summary, and expressed their dissatisfaction
at being guillotined instead of being shot for the patriotic
deeds of which they were declared guilty. They thought they
deserved to be treated as soldiers.
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Among those executed in Cologne were some young people of
eighteen and nineteen years of age and one woman. Some French
women, who were political prisoners, were taken from the Lübeck
prison in order to be executed in Hamburg. They were nearly
always charged with the same thing, “helping the enemy.” The
flies are incomplete, but we have those of the chief Prosecutor of
Cologne. In every case the offenses committed were of the same
nature. Keitel systematically rejected all appeals for mercy which
were submitted to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the lot of those who were held in the prisons was very
hard and sometimes terrible, it was infinitely less cruel than the
fate of those Frenchmen who had the misfortune to be interned in
the concentration camps. The Tribunal is well informed about these
camps; my colleagues of the United Nations have presented a long
statement on this matter. The Tribunal will remember that it has
already been shown a map indicating the exact location of every
camp which existed in Germany and in the occupied countries. We
shall not, therefore, revert to the geographical distribution of the
camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the permission of the Tribunal I should now like to deal
with the conditions under which Frenchmen and nationals of the
western occupied countries were taken to these camps. Before their
departure the victims of arbitrary arrests, such as I described to
you this morning, were brought together in prisons or in assembly
camps in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main assembly camp in France was at Compiègne. It is from
there that most of the deportees left who were to be sent to Germany.
There were two other assembly camps, Beaune-La-Rolande
and Pithiviers, reserved especially for Jews, and Drancy. The conditions
under which people were interned in those camps were somewhat
similar to those under which internees in the German prisons
lived. With your permission, I shall not dwell any longer on this.
The Tribunal will have taken judicial notice of the declarations
made by M. Blechmann and Mme. Jacob in Document Number F-457,
which I am now lodging as Exhibit Number RF-328. To avoid
making these discussions too long and too ponderous with long
quotations and testimonies which, after all, are very similar, we
shall confine ourselves to reading to the Tribunal a passage from
the testimony of Mme. Jacob concerning the conduct of the German
Red Cross. This passage is to be found at the bottom of Page 4
of the French document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We received a visit from several German personalities, such
as Stülpnagel, Du Paty de Clam, Commissioner for Jewish
Questions, and Colonel Baron Von Berg, Vice President of the
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
German Red Cross. This Von Berg was very formal and very
pompous. He always wore the small insignia of the Red
Cross, which did not prevent his being inhuman and a thief.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And on Page 6, the penultimate paragraph, Colonel Von Berg
was, as we have already said earlier, very pompous. I skip two
lines.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In spite of his title of Vice President of the German Red
Cross, of which he dared to wear the insignia, he selected at
random a number of our comrades for deportation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the assembly center of Compiègne, the Tribunal will
find, in Document F-274, Exhibit Number 301, Pages 14 and 15, some
details about the fate of the internees. I do not think it is necessary
to read them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Norway, Holland, and Belgium there were, as in France,
assembly camps. The most typical of these camps, and certainly
the best known, is the Breendonck Camp in Belgium, about which
it is necessary to give the Tribunal a few details because a great
many Belgians were interned there and died of privations, hardships,
and tortures of all kinds; or were executed either by shooting
or by hanging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This camp was established in the Fortress of Breendonck in 1940,
and we are now extracting from a document which we have already
deposited under Document Number F-231 and which is also known
under UK-76 (Exhibit Number RF-329), a few details about the
conditions prevailing in that camp. It is the fourth document in
your document book and is entitled “Report on the Concentration
Camp of Breendonck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What did you say the name of the camp is?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Breendonck, B-r-e-e-n-d-o-n-c-k.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will ask the Tribunal to be good enough to grant us a few
minutes. Our duty is to expose in rather more detail the conditions
at this camp, because a considerable number of Belgians were
interned there and their internment took a rather special form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans occupied this fort in August 1940, and they brought
the internees there in September. They were Jews. The Belgian
Government has not been able to find out how many people were
interned from September 1940 to August 1944, when the camp was
evacuated and Belgium liberated. Nevertheless, it is thought that
about 3,000 to 3,600 internees passed through the camp of Breendonck.
About 250 died of privation, 450 were shot, and 12 were
hanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we must bear in mind the fact that the majority of the
prisoners in Breendonck were transferred at various times to camps
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
in Germany. Most of these transferred prisoners did not return.
There should, therefore, be added to those who died in Breendonck,
all those who did not survive their captivity in Germany. Various
categories of prisoners were taken into the camp: Jews—for whom
the regime was more severe than for the others—Communists and
Marxists, of which there were a good many, in spite of the fact
that those who interrogated them had nothing definite against them;
persons who belonged to the resistance, people who had been
denounced to the Germans, hostages—among them M. Bouchery,
former minister, and M. Van Kesbeek, who was a liberal deputy,
were interned there for ten weeks as a reprisal for the throwing
of a grenade on the main square of Malines. These two died after
their liberation as a result of the ill-treatment which they endured
in that camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were also in that camp some black market operators, and
the Belgian Government says of them that “they were not ill-treated,
and were even given preferential treatment.” That is in Paragraph
(e) of Page 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners were compelled to work. The most repugnant
collective punishments were inflicted on the slightest pretext. One
of these punishments consisted in forcing the internees to crawl
under the beds and to stand up at command; this was done to the
accompaniment of whipping. You will find that at the top of Page 10.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same page is a description of the conditions of the prisoners
who were isolated from the others and kept in solitary confinement.
They were forced to wear hoods every time they had to
leave their cells or when they had to come in contact with other
prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is a long report, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is why I am summarizing it rather than
reading it; and I do not think I can make it any shorter, as it was
given to me by the Belgian Government, which attaches a great
importance to the brutalities, excesses, and atrocities that were committed
by the Germans in the Camp of Breendonck and suffered
by the whole of the population, especially the Belgian elite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, I understand. You are summarizing
it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am now summarizing it, Mr. President. I had
reached, in my summary, the description of the life of these prisoners
who had been put into cells and who sometimes wore handcuffs
and had shackles on their feet attached to an iron ring in the
wall. They could not leave their cells without being forced to wear
hoods.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these prisoners, M. Paquet, states that he spent eight
months under such a regime; and when, one day, he tried to lift
the hood to see his way, he received a violent blow with the butt
of a gun which broke three vertebrae in his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 12 concerns the following: discipline, labor, acts of brutality,
murders. We are told that the work of the prisoners consisted
in removing the earth covering the fort and carrying it outside the
moat. This work was done by hand. It was very laborious and
dangerous and caused the loss of a great many human lives. Small
trucks were used. The trucks were hurled along the rails by the
SS and often broke the legs of the prisoners who were not warned
of their approach. The SS made a game of this, and at the slightest
stoppage of work they would rush at the internees and beat them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same page we are told that frequently, for no reason at
all, the prisoners were thrown into the moat surrounding the fort.
According to the report of the Belgian Government, dozens of prisoners
were drowned. Some prisoners were killed after they had
been buried up to their necks, and the SS finished them off by
kicking them or beating them with a stick. Food, clothing, correspondence,
and medical care—all this information is given in this
report as in all the other similar reports which I have already read
to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conclusion is important and should be read in part—second
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The former internees of Breendonck, many of whom have
had experience of the concentration camps in Germany—Buchenwald,
Neuengamme, Oranienburg—state that, generally
speaking, the conditions prevailing at Breendonck in regard
to discipline and food were worse. They add that in the
camps in Germany, which were more crowded, they felt less
under the domination of their guards and had the feeling that
their lives were less in danger.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The figures given in this report are only minimum figures. To
give but one example (last paragraph of the last page), M. Verheirstraeten
declares that he put 120 people in their coffins during
the two months of December 1942 and January 1943. If one bears
in mind the executions of the 6th and 13th of January, each of which
accounted for the lives of 20 persons, we see that at that time, that
is to say, over a period of two months, 80 persons died of disease or
ill-treatment. From these camps the internees were transported to
Germany in convoys, and a description of these should be given to
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal should know, first of all, that from France alone,
excluding the three Departments of the Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin, and
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
Moselle, 326 convoys left between 1 January 1944 and 25 August of
the same year, that is to say, an average of ten convoys a week.
Now each convoy transported from 1,000 to 2,000 persons; and we
know now, from what our witness said just now, that each truck
carried from 60 to 120 individuals. It appears that there left from
France, excluding the above-mentioned three northern departments,
3 convoys in 1940, 19 convoys in 1941, 104 convoys in 1942, and 257
convoys in 1943. These are the figures given in the documents submitted
under Number F-274, Exhibit Number RF-301, Page 14.
These convoys nearly always left from the Compiègne Camp where
more than 50,000 internees were registered and from there 78 convoys
left in 1943 and 95 convoys in 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purpose of these deportations was to terrorize the populations.
The Tribunal will remember the text already read; how
the families, not knowing what became of the internees, were seized
with terror and advantage was taken of this to round-up more
workers to help German labor which had become depleted owing to
the war with Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which these deportations were carried out not
only made it possible more or less to select this labor; but it constituted
the first stage of a new aspect of German policy, that is,
purely and simply the extermination of all racial or intellectual
categories whose political activity appeared as a menace to the Nazi
leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These deportees, who were locked up 80 or 120 in each truck, in
any season, could neither sit nor crouch and were given nothing
whatsoever to eat or drink during their journey. In this connection
we would particularly like to bring Dr. Steinberg’s testimony taken
by Lieutenant Colonel Badin of the Office for Inquiry into War
Crimes in Paris, Document Number F-392, which we submit as
Exhibit Number RF-330, which is the 12th in your document book.
We will read only a few paragraphs on Page 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We were crowded into cattle trucks, about 70 in each. Sanitary
conditions were frightful. Our journey lasted two days.
We reached Auschwitz on 24 June 1942. It should be noted
that we had been given no food at all when we left and that
we had to live during those two days on what little food we
had taken with us from Drancy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The deportees were at times refused water by the German Red
Cross. Evidence was taken by the Ministry of Prisoners and Deportees,
and this appears in Document RF-301, Page 18. It is about
a convoy of Jewish women which left Bobigny station on 19 June
1942:
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“They travelled for three days and three nights, dying of
thirst. At Breslau they begged the nurses of the German Red
Cross to give them a little water, but in vain.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Lieutenant Geneste and Dr. Bloch have testified to
the same facts and other different facts; and in Document Number
F-321, Exhibit Number RF-331, entitled “Concentration Camps,”
which we have been able to submit to you in French, Russian, and
German, the English version having been exhausted, on Page 21,
you will find, “In the station of Bremen water was refused to us
by the German Red Cross, who said that there was no water.” This
is the testimony by Lieutenant Geneste of O.R.C.G. Concerning this
conduct of the German Red Cross and to finish dealing with the
subject, there is one more word to be said. Document RF-331 gives
you, on Page 162, the proof that that was an ambulance car bearing
a red cross which carried gas in iron containers destined for the
gas chambers of Auschwitz Camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now until Monday.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: With the authorization of the Court, I should like
to proceed with this part of the presentation of the French case by
hearing a witness who, for more than 3 years, lived in German
concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Mme. Vaillant-Couturier, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you stand up, please? Do you wish
to swear the French oath? Will you tell me your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MADAME MARIE CLAUDE VAILLANT-COUTURIER (Witness):
Claude Vaillant-Couturier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
that I will speak without hate or fear, that I will tell the truth, all
the truth, nothing but the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raise your right hand and say, “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Please, will you sit down and speak slowly.
Your name is?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Vaillant-Couturier, Marie,
Claude, Vögel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is your name Madame Vaillant-Couturier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are the widow of M. Vaillant-Couturier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were born in Paris on 3 November 1912?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: And you are of French nationality, French born,
and of parents who were of French nationality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are a deputy in the Constituent Assembly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are a Knight of the Legion of Honor?
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You have just been decorated by General Legentilhomme
at the Invalides?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you arrested and deported? Will you please
give your testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I was arrested on 9 February
1942 by Petain’s French police, who handed me over to the German
authorities after 6 weeks. I arrived on 20 March at Santé prison
in the German quarter. I was questioned on 9 June 1942. At the
end of my interrogation they wanted me to sign a statement which
was not consistent with what I had said. I refused to sign it. The
officer who had questioned me threatened me; and when I told him
that I was not afraid of death nor of being shot, he said, “But we
have at our disposal means for killing that are far worse than
merely shooting.” And the interpreter said to me, “You do not
know what you have just done. You are going to leave for a concentration
camp in Germany. One never comes back from there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were then taken to prison?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I was taken back to the Santé
prison where I was placed in solitary confinement. However, I was
able to communicate with my neighbors through the piping and the
windows. I was in a cell next to that of Georges Politzer, the
philosopher, and Jacques Solomon, physicist. Mr. Solomon is the
son-in-law of Professor Langevin, a pupil of Curie, one of the first
to study atomic disintegration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Georges Politzer told me through the piping that during his
interrogation, after having been tortured, he was asked whether he
would write theoretical pamphlets for National Socialism. When he
refused, he was told that he would be in the first train of hostages
to be shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Jacques Solomon, he also was horribly tortured and then
thrown into a dark cell and came out only on the day of his
execution to say goodbye to his wife, who also was under arrest
at the Santé. Hélène Solomon-Langevin told me in Romainville,
where I found her when I left the Santé, that when she went to
her husband he moaned and said, “I cannot take you in my arms,
because I can no longer move them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every time that the internees came back from their questioning
one could hear moaning through the windows, and they all said that
they could not make any movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several times during the 5 months I spent at the Santé hostages
were taken to be shot. When I left the Santé on 20 August 1942,
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
I was taken to the Fortress of Romainville, which was a camp for
hostages. There I was present on two occasions when they took
hostages, on 21 August and 22 September. Among the hostages who
were taken away were the husbands of the women who were with
me and who left for Auschwitz. Most of them died there. These
women, for the most part, had been arrested only because of the
activity of their husbands. They themselves had done nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: When did you leave for Auschwitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I left for Auschwitz on 23 January
1943, and arrived there on the 27th.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you with a convoy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I was with a convoy of 230
French women; among us were Danielle Casanova who died in
Auschwitz, Maï Politzer who died in Auschwitz, and Hélène Solomon.
There were some elderly women .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was their social position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: They were intellectuals, school
teachers; they came from all walks of life. Maï Politzer was a
doctor, and the wife of the philosopher Georges Politzer. Hélène
Solomon is the wife of the physicist Solomon; she is the daughter
of Professor Langevin. Danielle Casanova was a dental surgeon
and she was very active among the women. It is she who organized
a resistance movement among the wives of prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many of you came back out of 230?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Forty-nine. In the convoy there
were some elderly women. I remember one who was 67 and had
been arrested because she had in her kitchen the shotgun of her
husband, which she kept as a souvenir and had not declared because
she did not want it to be taken from her. She died after a fortnight
at Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When you said only 49 came back, did you
mean only 49 arrived at Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No, only 49 came back to
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were also cripples, among them a singer who had only
one leg. She was taken out and gassed at Auschwitz. There was
also a young girl of 16, a college girl, Claudine Guérin; she also
died at Auschwitz. There were also two women who had been
acquitted by the German military tribunal, Marie Alonzo and Marie-Thérèse
Fleuri; they died at Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a terrible journey. We were 60 in a car and we were
given no food or drink during the journey. At the various stopping
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
places we asked the Lorraine soldiers of the Wehrmacht who were
guarding us whether we would arrive soon; and they replied, “If
you knew where you are going you would not be in a hurry to
get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We arrived at Auschwitz at dawn. The seals on our cars were
broken, and we were driven out by blows with the butt end of a
rifle, and taken to the Birkenau Camp, a section of the Auschwitz
Camp. It is situated in the middle of a great plain, which was
frozen in the month of January. During this part of the journey we
had to drag our luggage. As we passed through the door we knew
only too well how slender our chances were that we would come
out again, for we had already met columns of living skeletons
going to work; and as we entered we sang “The Marseillaise” to
keep up our courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were led to a large shed, then to the disinfecting station.
There our heads were shaved and our registration numbers were
tattooed on the left forearm. Then we were taken into a large room
for a steam bath and a cold shower. In spite of the fact that we
were naked, all this took place in the presence of SS men and
women. We were then given clothing which was soiled and torn,
a cotton dress and jacket of the same material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As all this had taken several hours, we saw from the windows
of the block where we were, the camp of the men; and toward the
evening an orchestra came in. It was snowing and we wondered
why they were playing music. We then saw that the camp foremen
were returning to the camp. Each foreman was followed by men
who were carrying the dead. As they could hardly drag themselves
along, every time they stumbled they were put on their feet again
by being kicked or by blows with the butt end of a rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that we were taken to the block where we were to live.
There were no beds but only bunks, measuring 2 by 2 meters, and
there nine of us had to sleep the first night without any mattress
or blanket. We remained in blocks of this kind for several months.
We could not sleep all night, because every time one of the nine
moved—this happened unceasingly because we were all ill—she
disturbed the whole row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 3:30 in the morning the shouting of the guards woke us up,
and with cudgel blows we were driven from our bunks to go to roll
call. Nothing in the world could release us from going to the roll
call; even those who were dying had to be dragged there. We had
to stand there in rows of five until dawn, that is, 7 or 8 o’clock in
the morning in winter; and when there was a fog, sometimes until
noon. Then the commandos would start on their way to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Excuse me, can you describe the roll call?
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: For roll call we were lined up
in rows of five; and we waited until daybreak, until the Aufseherinnen,
the German women guards in uniform, came to count
us. They had cudgels and they beat us more or less at random.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a comrade, Germaine Renaud, a school teacher from
Azay-le-Rideau in France, who had her skull broken before my
eyes from a blow with a cudgel during the roll call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work at Auschwitz consisted of clearing demolished houses,
road building, and especially the draining of marsh land. This was
by far the hardest work, for all day long we had our feet in the
water and there was the danger of being sucked down. It frequently
happened that we had to pull out a comrade who had sunk in up
to the waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the work the SS men and women who stood guard over
us would beat us with cudgels and set their dogs on us. Many of
our friends had their legs torn by the dogs. I even saw a woman
torn to pieces and die under my very eyes when Tauber, a member
of the SS, encouraged his dog to attack her and grinned at the sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The causes of death were extremely numerous. First of all, there
was the complete lack of washing facilities. When we arrived at
Auschwitz, for 12,000 internees there was only one tap of water,
unfit for drinking, and it was not always flowing. As this tap was
in the German wash house we could reach it only by passing
through the guards, who were German common-law women prisoners,
and they beat us horribly as we went by. It was therefore
almost impossible to wash ourselves or our clothes. For more than
3 months we remained without changing our clothes. When there
was snow, we melted some to wash in. Later, in the spring, when
we went to work we would drink from a puddle by the road-side
and then wash our underclothes in it. We took turns washing our
hands in this dirty water. Our companions were dying of thirst,
because we got only half a cup of some herbal tea twice a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Please describe in detail one of the roll calls at the
beginning of February.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: On 5 February there was what
is called a general roll call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In what year was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: In 1943. At 3:30 the whole
camp .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In the morning at 3:30?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: In the morning at 3:30 the
whole camp was awakened and sent out on the plain, whereas
normally the roll call was at 3:30 but inside the camp. We remained
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
out in front of the camp until 5 in the afternoon, in the snow,
without any food. Then when the signal was given we had to go
through the door one by one, and we were struck in the back with
a cudgel, each one of us, in order to make us run. Those who could
not run, either because they were too old or too ill were caught by
a hook and taken to Block 25, “waiting block” for the gas chamber.
On that day 10 of the French women of our convoy were thus
caught and taken to Block 25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all the internees were back in the camp, a party to which
I belonged was organized to go and pick up the bodies of the dead
which were scattered over the plain as on a battlefield. We carried
to the yard of Block 25 the dead and the dying without distinction,
and they remained there stacked up in a pile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Block 25, which was the anteroom of the gas chamber, if
one may express it so, is well known to me because at that time we
had been transferred to Block 26 and our windows opened on the
yard of Number 25. One saw stacks of corpses piled up in the
courtyard, and from time to time a hand or a head would stir
among the bodies, trying to free itself. It was a dying woman
attempting to get free and live. The rate of mortality in that block
was even more terrible than elsewhere because, having been condemned
to death, they received food or drink only if there was
something left in the cans in the kitchen; which means that very
often they went for several days without a drop of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of our companions, Annette Épaux, a fine young woman
of 30, passing the block one day, was overcome with pity for those
women who moaned from morning till night in all languages,
“Drink. Drink. Water!” She came back to our block to get a little
herbal tea, but as she was passing it through the bars of the
window she was seen by the Aufseherin, who took her by the neck
and threw her into Block 25. All my life I will remember Annette
Épaux. Two days later I saw her on the truck which was taking the
internees to the gas chamber. She had her arms around another
French woman, old Line Porcher, and when the truck started
moving she cried, “Think of my little boy, if you ever get back to
France.” Then they started singing “The Marseillaise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Block 25, in the courtyard, there were rats as big as cats
running about and gnawing the corpses and even attacking the
dying who had not enough strength left to chase them away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another cause of mortality and epidemics was the fact that we
were given food in large red mess tins, which were merely rinsed
in cold water after each meal. As all the women were ill and had
not the strength during the night to go to the trench which was
used as a lavatory, the access to which was beyond description, they
used these containers for a purpose for which they were not meant.
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
The next day the mess tins were collected and taken to a refuse
heap. During the day another team would come and collect them,
wash them in cold water, and put them in use again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another cause of death was the problem of shoes. In the snow
and mud of Poland leather shoes were completely destroyed at the
end of a week or two. Therefore our feet were frozen and covered
with sores. We had to sleep with our muddy shoes on, lest they be
stolen, and when the time came to get up for roll call cries of
anguish could be heard: “My shoes have been stolen.” Then one
had to wait until the whole block had been emptied to look under
the bunks for odd shoes. Sometimes one found two shoes for the
same foot, or one shoe and one sabot. One could go to roll call like
that but it was an additional torture for work, because sores formed
on our feet which quickly became infected for lack of care. Many
of our companions went to the Revier for sores on their feet and
legs and never came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What did they do to the internees who came to
roll call without shoes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: The Jewish internees who
came without shoes were immediately taken to Block 25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They were gassed then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: They were gassed for any
reason whatsoever. Their conditions were moreover absolutely
appalling. Although we were crowded 800 in a block and could
scarcely move, they were 1,500 to a block of similar dimensions, so
that many of them could not sleep or even lie down during the
whole night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you talk about the Revier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: To reach the Revier one had to
go first to the roll call. Whatever the state was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Would you please explain what the Revier was in
the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: The Revier was the blocks
where the sick were put. This place could not be given the name of
hospital, because it did not correspond in any way to our idea of a
hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To go there one had first to obtain authorization from the block
chief who seldom gave it. When it was finally granted we were led
in columns to the infirmary where, no matter what weather,
whether it snowed or rained, even if one had a temperature of 40°
(centigrade) one had to wait for several hours standing in a queue
to be admitted. It frequently happened that patients died outside
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
before the door of the infirmary, before they could get in. Moreover,
lining up in front of the infirmary was dangerous because if
the queue was too long the SS came along, picked up all the women
who were waiting, and took them straight to Block Number 25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is to say, to the gas chamber?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: That is to say to the gas
chamber. That is why very often the women preferred not to go
to the Revier and they died at their work or at roll call. Every
day, after the evening roll call in winter time, dead were picked
up who had fallen into the ditches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only advantage of the Revier was that as one was in bed,
one did not have to go to roll call; but one lay in appalling conditions,
four in a bed of less than 1 meter in width, each suffering
from a different disease, so that anyone who came for leg sores
would catch typhus or dysentery from neighbors. The straw
mattresses were dirty and they were changed only when absolutely
rotten. The bedding was so full of lice that one could see them
swarming like ants. One of my companions, Marguerite Corringer,
told me that when she had typhus, she could not sleep all night
because of the lice. She spent the night shaking her blanket over
a piece of paper and emptying the lice into a receptacle by the bed,
and this went on for hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were practically no medicines. Consequently the patients
were left in their beds without any attention, without hygiene, and
unwashed. The dead lay in bed with the sick for several hours; and
finally, when they were noticed, they were simply tipped out of the
bed and taken outside the block. There the women porters would
come and carry the dead away on small stretchers, with heads and
legs dangling over the sides. From morning till night the carriers
of the dead went from the Revier to the mortuary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the big epidemics, in the winters of 1943 and 1944, the
stretchers were replaced by carts, as there were too many dead
bodies. During those periods of epidemics there were from 200 to
350 dead daily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many people died at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: During the big epidemics of
typhus in the winters of 1943 and 1944, from 200 to 350; it depended
on the days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was the Revier open to all the internees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No. When we arrived Jewish
women had not the right to be admitted. They were taken straight
to the gas chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Would you please tell us about the disinfection of
the blocks?
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: From time to time, owing to
the filth which caused the lice and gave rise to so many epidemics,
they disinfected the blocks with gas; but these disinfections were
also the cause of many deaths because, while the blocks were being
disinfected with gas, the prisoners were taken to the shower-baths.
Their clothes were taken away from them to be steamed. The
internees were left naked outside, waiting for their clothing to come
back from the steaming, and then they were given back to them all
wet. Even those who were sick, who could barely stand on their
feet, were sent to the showers. It is quite obvious that a great many
of them died in the course of these proceedings. Those who could
not move were washed all in the same bath during the disinfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How were you fed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: We had 200 grams of bread,
three-quarters or half a liter—it varied—of soup made from swedes,
and a few grams of margarine or a slice of sausage in the evening,
this daily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Regardless of the work that was exacted from the
internees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Regardless of the work that
was exacted from the internee. Some who had to work in the
factory of the “Union,” an ammunition factory where they made
grenades and shells, received what was called a “Zulage,” that is,
a supplementary ration, when the amount of their production was
satisfactory. Those internees had to go to roll call morning and
night as we did, and they were at work 12 hours in the factory.
They came back to the camp after the day’s work, making the
journey both ways on foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was this “Union” factory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: It was an ammunition factory.
I do not know to what company it belonged. It was called, the
“Union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was it the only factory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No, there was also, a large
Buna factory, but as I did not work there I do not know what was
made there. The internees who were taken to the Buna plant never
came back to our camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you tell us about experiments, if you witnessed
any?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: As to the experiments, I have
seen in the Revier, because I was employed at the Revier, the queue
of young Jewesses from Salonika who stood waiting in front of the
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
X-ray room for sterilization. I also know that they performed
castration operations in the men’s camp. Concerning the experiments
performed on women I am well informed, because my friend, Doctor
Hadé Hautval of Montbéliard, who has returned to France, worked
for several months in that block nursing the patients; but she always
refused to participate in those experiments. They sterilized women
either by injections or by operation or with rays. I saw and knew
several women who had been sterilized. There was a very high
mortality rate among those operated upon. Fourteen Jewesses from
France who refused to be sterilized were sent to a Strafarbeit
kommando, that is, hard labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did they come back from those kommandos?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Very seldom. Quite exceptionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the aim of the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Sterilization—they did not
conceal it. They said that they were trying to find the best method
for sterilizing so as to replace the native population in the occupied
countries by Germans after one generation, once they had made
use of the inhabitants as slaves to work for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In the Revier did you see any pregnant women?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes. The Jewish women, when
they arrived in the first months of pregnancy, were subjected to
abortion. When their pregnancy was near the end, after confinement,
the babies were drowned in a bucket of water. I know
that because I worked in the Revier and the woman who was in
charge of that task was a German midwife, who was imprisoned for
having performed illegal operations. After a while another doctor
arrived and for 2 months they did not kill the Jewish babies. But
one day an order came from Berlin saying that again they had to
be done away with. Then the mothers and their babies were called
to the infirmary. They were put in a lorry and taken away to the
gas chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Why did you say that an order came from Berlin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Because I knew the internees
who worked in the secretariat of the SS and in particular a Slovakian
woman by the name of Hertha Roth, who is now working
with UNRRA at Bratislava.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is it she who told you that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes, and moreover, I also knew
the men who worked in the gas kommando.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You have told us about the Jewish mothers. Were
there other mothers in your camp?
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes, in principle, non-Jewish
women were allowed to have their babies, and the babies were not
taken away from them; but conditions in the camp being so
horrible, the babies rarely lived for more than 4 or 5 weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one block where the Polish and Russian mothers were.
One day the Russian mothers, having been accused of making too
much noise, had to stand for roll call all day long in front of the
block, naked, with their babies in their arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the disciplinary system of the camp?
Who kept order and discipline? What were the punishments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Generally speaking, the SS
economized on many of their own personnel by employing internees
for watching the camp; SS only supervised. These internees were
chosen from German common-law criminals and prostitutes, and
sometimes those of other nationalities, but most of them were Germans.
By corruption, accusation, and terror they succeeded in
making veritable human beasts of them; and the internees had as
much cause to complain about them as about the SS themselves.
They beat us just as hard as the SS; and as to the SS, the men
behaved like the women and the women were as savage as the men.
There was no difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The system employed by the SS of degrading human beings to
the utmost by terrorizing them and causing them through fear to
commit acts which made them ashamed of themselves, resulted in
their being no longer human. This was what they wanted. It took
a great deal of courage to resist this atmosphere of terror and corruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who meted out punishments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: The SS leaders, men and
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the nature of the punishments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Bodily ill-treatment in particular.
One of the most usual punishments, was 50 blows with a stick
on the loins. They were administered with a machine which I saw,
a swinging apparatus manipulated by an SS. There were also
endless roll calls day and night, or gymnastics; flat on the belly, get
up, lie down, up, down, for hours, and anyone who fell was beaten
unmercifully and taken to Block 25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How did the SS behave towards the women? And
the women SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: At Auschwitz there was a
brothel for the SS and also one for the male internees of the staff,
who were called “Kapo.” Moreover, when the SS needed servants,
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
they came accompanied by the Oberaufseherin, that is, the woman
commandant of the camp, to make a choice during the process of
disinfection. They would point to a young girl, whom the Oberaufseherin
would take out of the ranks. They would look her over
and make jokes about her physique; and if she was pretty and they
liked her, they would hire her as a maid with the consent of the
Oberaufseherin, who would tell her that she was to obey them
absolutely no matter what they asked of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Why did they go during disinfection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Because during the disinfection
the women were naked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This system of demoralization and corruption—was
it exceptional?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No, the system was identical
in all the camps where I have been, and I have spoken to internees
coming from camps where I myself had never been; it was the
same thing everywhere. The system was identical no matter what
the camp was. There were, however, certain variations. I believe
that Auschwitz was one of the harshest; but later I went to Ravensbrück,
where there also was a house of ill fame and where recruiting
was also carried out among the internees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Then, according to you, everything was done to
degrade those women in their own sight?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What do you know about the convoy of Jews which
arrived from Romainville about the same time as yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: When we left Romainville the
Jewesses who were there at the same time as ourselves were left
behind. They were sent to Drancy and subsequently arrived at
Auschwitz, where we found them again 3 weeks later, 3 weeks after
our arrival. Of the original 1,200 only 125 actually came to the
camp; the others were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of
these 125 not one was left alive at the end of 1 month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transports operated as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we first arrived, whenever a convoy of Jews came, a
selection was made; first the old men and women, then the mothers
and the children were put into trucks together with the sick or those
whose constitution appeared to be delicate. They took in only the
young women and girls as well as the young men who were sent
to the men’s camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Generally speaking, of a convoy of about 1,000 to 1,500, seldom
more than 250—and this figure really was the maximum—actually
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
reached the camp. The rest were immediately sent to the gas
chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this selection also, they picked out women in good health
between the ages of 20 and 30, who were sent to the experimental
block; and young girls and slightly older women, or those who had
not been selected for that purpose, were sent to the camp where,
like ourselves, they were tattooed and shaved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was also, in the spring of 1944, a special block for twins.
It was during the time when large convoys of Hungarian Jews—about
700,000—arrived. Dr. Mengele, who was carrying out the
experiments, kept back from each convoy twin children and twins
in general, regardless of their age, so long as both were present. So
we had both babies and adults on the floor at that block. Apart from
blood tests and measuring I do not know what was done to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you an eye witness of the selections on the
arrival of the convoys?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes, because when we worked
at the sewing block in 1944, the block where we lived directly faced
the stopping place of the trains. The system had been improved.
Instead of making the selection at the place where they arrived,
a side line now took the train practically right up to the gas
chamber; and the stopping place, about 100 meters from the gas
chamber, was right opposite our block though, of course, separated
from us by two rows of barbed wire. Consequently, we saw the
unsealing of the cars and the soldiers letting men, women, and
children out of them. We then witnessed heart-rending scenes; old
couples forced to part from each other, mothers made to abandon
their young daughters, since the latter were sent to the camp,
whereas mothers and children were sent to the gas chambers. All
these people were unaware of the fate awaiting them. They were
merely upset at being separated, but they did not know that they
were going to their death. To render their welcome more pleasant
at this time—June-July 1944—an orchestra composed of internees,
all young and pretty girls dressed in little white blouses and navy
blue skirts, played during the selection, at the arrival of the trains,
gay tunes such as “The Merry Widow,” the “Barcarolle” from “The
Tales of Hoffman,” and so forth. They were then informed that this
was a labor camp and since they were not brought into the camp
they saw only the small platform surrounded by flowering plants.
Naturally, they could not realize what was in store for them. Those
selected for the gas chamber, that is, the old people, mothers, and
children, were escorted to a red-brick building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: These were not given an identification number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No.
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They were not tattooed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No. They were not even counted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were tattooed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes, look. [<span class='it'>The witness showed
her arm.</span>] They were taken to a red brick building, which bore the
letters “Baden,” that is to say “Baths.” There, to begin with, they
were made to undress and given a towel before they went into the
so-called shower room. Later on, at the time of the large convoys
from Hungary, they had no more time left to play-actor to pretend;
they were brutally undressed, and I know these details as I knew
a little Jewess from France who lived with her family at the
“République” district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In Paris?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: In Paris. She was called “little
Marie” and she was the only one, the sole survivor of a family of
nine. Her mother and her seven brothers and sisters had been
gassed on arrival. When I met her she was employed to undress the
babies before they were taken into the gas chamber. Once the
people were undressed they took them into a room which was
somewhat like a shower room, and gas capsules were thrown
through an opening in the ceiling. An SS man would watch the
effect produced through a porthole. At the end of 5 or 7 minutes,
when the gas had completed its work, he gave the signal to open
the doors; and men with gas masks—they too were internees—went
into the room and removed the corpses. They told us that the
internees must have suffered before dying, because they were
closely clinging to one another and it was very difficult to separate
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that a special squad would come to pull out gold teeth and
dentures; and again, when the bodies had been reduced to ashes,
they would sift them in an attempt to recover the gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Auschwitz there were eight crematories but, as from 1944,
these proved insufficient. The SS had large pits dug by the internees,
where they put branches, sprinkled with gasoline, which they set
on fire. Then they threw the corpses into the pits. From our block
we could see after about three-quarters of an hour or an hour after
the arrival of a convoy, large flames coming from the crematory,
and the sky was lighted up by the burning pits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night we were awakened by terrifying cries. And we discovered,
on the following day, from the men working in the
Sonderkommando—the “Gas Kommando”—that on the preceding
day, the gas supply having run out, they had thrown the children
into the furnaces alive.
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you tell us about the selections that were
made at the beginning of winter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Every year, towards the end
of the autumn, they proceeded to make selections on a large scale
in the Revier. The system appeared to work as follows—I say this
because I noticed the fact for myself during the time I spent in
Auschwitz. Others, who had stayed there even longer than I, had
observed the same phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring, all through Europe, they rounded up men and
women whom they sent to Auschwitz. They kept only those who
were strong enough to work all through the summer. During that
period naturally some died every day; but the strongest, those who
had succeeded in holding out for 6 months, were so exhausted that
they too had to go to the Revier. It was then in autumn that the
large scale selections were made, so as not to feed too many useless
mouths during the winter. All the women who were too thin were
sent to the gas chamber, as well as those who had long, drawn-out
illnesses; but the Jewesses were gassed for practically no reason at
all. For instance, they gassed everybody in the “scabies block,”
whereas everybody knows that with a little care, scabies can be
cured in 3 days. I remember the typhus convalescent block from
which 450 out of 500 patients were sent to the gas chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During Christmas 1944—no, 1943, Christmas 1943—when we
were in quarantine, we saw, since we lived opposite Block 25,
women brought to Block 25 stripped naked. Uncovered trucks were
then driven up and on them the naked women were piled, as many
as the trucks could hold. Each time a truck started, the infamous
Hessler—he was one of the criminals condemned to death at the
Lüneburg trials—ran after the truck and with his bludgeon repeatedly
struck the naked women going to their death. They knew
they were going to the gas chamber and tried to escape. They
were massacred. They attempted to jump from the truck and we,
from our own block, watched the trucks pass by and heard the
grievous wailing of all those women who knew they were going to
be gassed. Many of them could very well have lived on, since they
were suffering only from scabies and were, perhaps, a little too
undernourished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You told us, Madame, a little while ago, that the
deportees, from the moment they stepped off the train and without
even being counted, were sent to the gas chamber. What happened
to their clothing and their luggage?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: The non-Jews had to carry their
own luggage and were billeted in separate blocks, but when the
Jews arrived they had to leave all their belongings on the platform.
They were stripped before entering the gas chamber and all their
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
clothes, as well as all their belongings, were taken over to large
barracks and there sorted out by a Kommando named “Canada.”
Then everything was shipped to Germany: jewelry, fur coats,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Jewesses were sent to Auschwitz with their entire
families and since they had been told that this was a sort of ghetto
and were advised to bring all their goods and chattels along, they
consequently brought considerable riches with them. As for the
Jewesses from Salonika, I remember that on their arrival they were
given picture postcards, bearing the post office address of “Waldsee,”
a place which did not exist; and a printed text to be sent to
their families, stating, “We are doing very well here; we have work
and we are well treated. We await your arrival.” I myself saw the
cards in question; and the Schreiberinnen, that is, the secretaries
of the block, were instructed to distribute them among the internees
in order to post them to their families. I know that whole families
arrived as a result of these postcards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself know that the following affair occurred in Greece. I do
not know whether it happened in any other country, but in any
case it did occur in Greece (as well as in Czechoslovakia) that whole
families went to the recruiting office at Salonika in order to rejoin
their families. I remember one professor of literature from Salonika,
who, to his horror, saw his own father arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you tell us about the Gypsy camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Right next to our camp, on
the other side of the barbed wires, 3 meters apart, there were
two camps; one for Gypsies, which towards August 1944 was
completely gassed. These Gypsies came from all parts of Europe
including Germany. Likewise on the other side there was the
so-called family camp. These were Jews from the Ghetto of
Theresienstadt, who had been brought there and, unlike ourselves,
they had been neither tattooed nor shaved. Their clothes were
not taken from them and they did not have to work. They lived
like this for 6 months and at the end of 6 months the entire
family camp, amounting to some 6,000 or 7,000 Jews, was gassed.
A few days later other large convoys again arrived from Theresienstadt
with their families and 6 months later they too were gassed,
like the first inmates of the family camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Would you, Madame, please give us some details
as to what you saw when you were about to leave the camp, and
under what circumstances you left it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: We were in quarantine before
leaving Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: When was that?
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: We were in quarantine for
10 months, from the 15th of July 1943, yes, until May 1944. And
after that we returned to the camp for 2 months. Then we went
to Ravensbrück.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: These were all French women from your convoy,
who had survived?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes, all the surviving French women
of our convoy. We had heard from Jewesses who had
arrived from France, in July 1944, that an intensive campaign had
been carried out by the British Broadcasting Corporation in London,
in connection with our convoy, mentioning Maï Politzer, Danielle
Casanova, Hélène Solomon-Langevin, and myself. As a result of
this broadcast we knew that orders had been issued, from Berlin
to the effect that French women should be transported under better
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we were placed in quarantine. This was a block situated
opposite the camp and outside the barbed wire. I must say that
it is to this quarantine that the 49 survivors owed their lives,
because at the end of 4 months there were only 52 of us. Therefore
it is certain that we could not have survived 18 months of this
regime had we not had these 10 months of quarantine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This quarantine was imposed because exanthematic typhus was
raging at Auschwitz. One could leave the camp only to be freed
or to be transferred to another camp or to be summoned before
the court after spending 15 days in quarantine, these 15 days being
the incubation period for exanthematic typhus. Consequently, as
soon as the papers arrived announcing that the internee would
probably be liberated, she was placed in quarantine until the order
for her liberation was signed. This sometimes took several months
and 15 days was the minimum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now a policy existed for freeing German women common-law
criminals and asocial elements in order to employ them as workers
in the German factories. It is therefore impossible to imagine that
the whole of Germany was unaware of the existence of the concentration
camps and of what was going on there, since these women
had been released from the camps and it is difficult to believe that
they never mentioned them. Besides, in the factories where the
former internees were employed, the Vorarbeiterinnen (the forewomen)
were German civilians in contact with the internees and
able to speak to them. The forewomen from Auschwitz, who
subsequently came to Siemens at Ravensbrück as Aufseherinnen, had
been former workers at Siemens in Berlin. They met forewomen
they had known in Berlin, and, in our presence, they told them what
they had seen at Auschwitz. It is therefore incredible that this was
not known in Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We could not believe our eyes when we left Auschwitz and our
hearts were sore when we saw the small group of 49 women; all
that was left of the 230 who had entered the camp 18 months earlier.
But to us it seemed that we were leaving hell itself, and for the first
time hopes of survival, of seeing the world again, were vouchsafed
to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Where were you sent then, Madame?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: On leaving Auschwitz we were
sent to Ravensbrück. There we were escorted to the “NN” block—meaning
“Nacht und Nebel”, that is, “The Secret Block.” With us
in that block were Polish women with the identification number
“7,000.” Some were called “rabbits” because they had been used as
experimental guinea pigs. They selected from the convoys girls with
very straight legs who were in very good health, and they submitted
them to various operations. Some of the girls had parts of the bone
removed from their legs, others received injections; but what was
injected, I do not know. The mortality rate was very high among
the women operated upon. So when they came to fetch the others to
operate on them they refused to go to the Revier. They were forcibly
dragged to the dark cells where the professor, who had arrived
from Berlin, operated in his uniform, without taking any aseptic
precautions, without wearing a surgical gown, and without washing
his hands. There are some survivors among these “rabbits.” They
still endure much suffering. They suffer periodically from suppurations;
and since nobody knows to what treatment they had been
subjected, it is extremely difficult to cure them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were these internees tattooed on their arrival?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No. People were not tattooed
at Ravensbrück; but, on the other hand, we had to go up for a
gynecological examination, and since no precautions were ever taken
and the same instruments were frequently used in all cases, infections
spread, partly because common-law prisoners and political internees
were all herded together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Block 32 where we were billeted there were also some Russian
women prisoners of war, who had refused to work voluntarily in the
ammunition factories. For that reason they had been sent to Ravensbrück.
Since they persisted in their refusal, they were subjected to
every form of petty indignity. They were, for instance, forced to
stand in front of the block a whole day long without any food. Some
of them were sent in convoys to Barth. Others were employed to
carry lavatory receptacles in the camp. The Strafblock (penitentiary
block) and the Bunker also housed internees who had refused
to work in the war factories.
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Are you now speaking about the prisons in the
camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: About the prisons in the camp.
As a matter of fact I have visited the camp prison. It was a civilian
prison, a real one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many French were there in that camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: From 8 to 10 thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many women all told?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: At the time of liberation the
identification numbers amounted to 105,000 and possibly more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were also executions in the camps. The numbers were
called at roll call in the morning, and the victims then left for the
Kommandantur and were never seen again. A few days later the
clothes were sent down to the Effektenkammer, where the clothes of
the internees were kept. After a certain time their cards would
vanish from the filing cabinets in the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The system of detention was the same as at
Auschwitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No. In Auschwitz, obviously,
extermination was the sole aim and object. Nobody was at all interested
in the output. We were beaten for no reason whatsoever. It
was sufficient to stand from morning till evening but whether we
carried one brick or 10 was of no importance at all. We were quite
aware that the human element was employed as slave labor in order
to kill us, that this was the ultimate purpose, whereas at Ravensbrück
the output was of great importance. It was a clearing camp.
When the convoys arrived at Ravensbrück, they were rapidly
dispatched either to the munition or to the powder factories, either
to work at the airfields or, latterly, to dig trenches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following procedure was adopted for going to the factories:
The manufacturers or their foremen or else their representatives
were coming themselves to choose their workers, accompanied by SS
men; the effect was that of a slave market. They felt the muscles,
examined the faces to see if the person looked healthy, and then
made their choice. Finally, they made them walk naked past the
doctor and he eventually decided if a woman was fit or not to leave
for work in the factories. Latterly, the doctor’s visit became a mere
formality as they ended by employing anybody who came along.
The work was exhausting, principally because of lack of food and
sleep, since in addition to 12 solid hours of work one had to attend
roll call in the morning and in the evening. In Ravensbrück there
was the Siemens factory, where telephone equipment was manufactured
as well as wireless sets for aircraft. Then there were
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
workshops in the camp for camouflage material and uniforms and for
various utensils used by soldiers. One of these I know best .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we had better break off now for
10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Madame, did you see any SS chiefs and members
of the Wehrmacht visit the camps of Ravensbrück and Auschwitz
when you were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know if any German Government officials
came to visit these camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I know it only as far as Himmler
is concerned. Apart from Himmler I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who were the guards in these camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: At the beginning there were
the SS guards, exclusively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you please speak more slowly so that the
interpreters can follow you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: At the beginning there were
only SS men, but from the spring of 1944 the young SS men in many
companies were replaced by older men of the Wehrmacht both at
Auschwitz and also at Ravensbrück. We were guarded by soldiers
of the Wehrmacht as from 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You can therefore testify that on the order of the
German General Staff the German Army was implicated in the
atrocities which you have described?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Obviously, since we were
guarded by the Wehrmacht as well, and this could not have occurred
without orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your testimony is final and involves both the SS
and the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Absolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you tell us about the arrival at Ravensbrück
in the winter of 1944, of Hungarian Jewesses who had been arrested
en masse? You were in Ravensbrück—this is a fact about which you
can testify?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes, of course I was there.
There was no longer any room left in the blocks, and the prisoners
already slept four in a bed, so there was raised, in the middle of the
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
camp, a large tent. Straw was spread in the tent, and the Hungarian
women were brought to this tent. Their condition was frightful.
There were a great many cases of frozen feet because they had been
evacuated from Budapest and had walked a good part of the way in
the snow. A great many of them had died en route. Those who
arrived at Auschwitz were led to this tent and there an enormous
number of them died. Every day a squad came to remove the corpses
in the tent. One day, on returning to my block, which was next to
this tent, during the cleaning up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Madame, are you speaking of Ravensbrück or
of Auschwitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: [<span class='it'>In English.</span>] Now I am speaking
of Ravensbrück. [<span class='it'>In French.</span>] It was in the winter of 1944, about
November or December, I believe, though I cannot say for certain
which month it was. It is so difficult to give a precise date in the
concentration camps since one day of torture is followed by another
day of similar torment and the prevailing monotony makes it very
hard to keep track of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day therefore, as I was saying, I passed the tent while it was
being cleaned, and I saw a pile of smoking manure in front of it.
I suddenly realized that this manure was human excrement since the
unfortunate women no longer had the strength to drag themselves to
the lavatories. They were therefore rotting in this filth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What were the conditions in the workshops where
the jackets were manufactured?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: At the workshops where the
uniforms were manufactured.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was it the camp workshop?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: It was the camp workshop,
known as “Schneiderei I.” Two hundred jackets or pairs of trousers
were manufactured per day. There were two shifts; a day and a night
shift, both working 12 hours. The night shift, when starting work
at midnight, after the standard amount of work had been reached—but
only then—received a thin slice of bread. Later on this practice
was discontinued. Work was carried on at a furious pace; the
internees could not even take time off to go the lavatories. Both day
and night they were terribly beaten, both by the SS women and men,
if a needle broke owing to the poor quality of the thread, if the
machine stopped, or if these “ladies” and “gentlemen” did not like
their looks. Towards the end of the night one could see that the
workers were so exhausted, that every movement was an effort to
them. Beads of sweat stood out on their foreheads. They could not
see clearly. When the standard amount of work was not reached the
foreman, Binder, rushed up and beat up, with all his might, one
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
woman after another all along the line, with the result that the last
in the row waited their turn petrified with terror. If one wished to
go to the Revier one had to receive the authorization of the SS, who
granted it very rarely; and even then, if the doctor did give a woman
a permit authorizing her to stay away from work for a few days, the
SS guards would often come round and fetch her out of bed in order
to put her back at her machine. The atmosphere was frightful since,
by reason of the “black-out,” one could not open the windows at
night. Six hundred women therefore worked for 12 hours without
any ventilation. All those who worked at the Schneiderei became
like living skeletons after a few months. They began to cough, their
eyesight failed, they developed a nervous twitching of the face for
fear of beatings to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew well the conditions of this workshop since my little friend,
Marie Rubiano, a little French girl who had just passed 3 years in the
prison of Kottbus, was sent, on her arrival at Ravensbrück, to the
Schneiderei; and every evening she would tell me about her
martyrdom. One day, when she was quite exhausted, she obtained
permission to go to the Revier; and as on that day the German
Schwester (nursing sister), Erica, was less evil-tempered than usual,
she was X-rayed. Both lungs were severely infected and she was
sent to the horrible Block 10, the block of the consumptives. This
block was particularly terrifying, since tubercular patients were not
considered as “recuperable material”; they received no treatment;
and because of shortage of staff, they were not even washed. We
might even say that there were no medical supplies at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Marie was placed in the ward housing patients with
bacillary infections, in other words, such patients as were considered
incurable. She spent some weeks there and had no courage left to
put up a fight for her life. I must say that the atmosphere of this
room was particularly depressing. There were many patients—several
to one bed in three-tier bunks—in an overheated atmosphere,
lying between internees of various nationalities, so that they could
not even speak to one another. Then, too, the silence in this antechamber
of death was only broken by the yells of the German asocial
personnel on duty and, from time to time, by the muffled sobs of a
little French girl thinking of her mother and of her country which
she would never see again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, Marie Rubiano did not die fast enough to please the SS.
So one day Dr. Winkelmann, selection specialist at Ravensbrück,
entered her name in the black-list and on 9 February 1945, together
with 72 other consumptive women, 6 of whom were French, she was
shoved on the truck for the gas chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this period, in all the Revieren, selections were made and
all patients considered unfit for work were sent to the gas chamber.
The Ravensbrück gas chamber was situated just behind the wall of
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
the camp, next to the crematory. When the trucks came to fetch the
patients we heard the sound of the motor across the camp, and the
noise ceased right by the crematory whose chimney rose above the
high wall of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of the liberation I returned to these places. I visited
the gas chamber which was a hermetically sealed building made of
boards, and inside it one could still smell the disagreeable odor of
gas. I know that at Auschwitz the gases were the same as those
which were used against the lice, and the only traces they left were
small, pale green crystals which were swept out when the windows
were opened. I know these details, since the men employed in
delousing the blocks were in contact with the personnel who gassed
the victims and they told them that one and the same gas was used
in both cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was this the only way used to exterminate the
internees in Ravensbrück?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: In Block 10 they also experimented
with a white powder. One day the German Schwester,
Martha, arrived in the block and distributed a powder to some 20
patients. The patients subsequently fell into a deep sleep. Four or
five of them were seized with violent fits of vomiting and this saved
their lives. During the night the snores gradually ceased and the
patients died. This I know because I went every day to visit the
French women in the block. Two of the nurses were French and Dr.
Louise Le Porz, a native of Bordeaux who came back, can likewise
testify to this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was this a frequent occurrence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: During my stay this was the
only case of its kind within the Revier but the system was also
applied at the Jugendlager, so called because it was a former reform
school for German juvenile delinquents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the beginning of 1945 Dr. Winkelmann, no longer satisfied
with selections in the Revier, proceeded to make his selections in
the blocks. All the prisoners had to answer roll call in their bare
feet and expose their breasts and legs. All those who were sick, too
old, too thin, or whose legs were swollen with oedema, were set aside
and then sent to this Jugendlager, a quarter of an hour away from
the camp at Ravensbrück. I visited it at the liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the blocks an order had been circulated to the effect that the
old women and the patients who could no longer work should apply
in writing for admission to the Jugendlager, where they would be
far better off, where they would not have to work, and where there
would be no roll call. We learned about this later through some of
the people who worked at the Jugendlager—the chief of the camp was
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
an Austrian woman, Betty Wenz, whom I knew from Auschwitz—and
from a few of the survivors, one of whom is Irène Ottelard, a
French woman living in Drancy, 17 Rue de la Liberté, who was
repatriated at the same time as myself and whom I had nursed after
the liberation. Through her we discovered the details about the
Jugendlager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you tell us, Madame, if you can answer this
question? Were the SS doctors who made the selection acting on
their own accord or were they merely obeying orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: They were acting on orders
received, since one of them, Dr. Lukas, refused to participate in the
selections and was withdrawn from the camp, and Dr. Winkelmann
was sent from Berlin to replace him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you personally witness these facts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: It was he himself who told the
Chief of the Block 10 and Dr. Louise Le Porz, when he left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Could you give us some information about the
conditions in which the men at the neighboring camp at Ravensbrück
lived on the day after the liberation, when you were able to see
them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I think it advisable to speak of
the Jugendlager first since, chronologically speaking, it comes first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If you wish it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: At the Jugendlager the old
women and the patients who had left our camp were placed in blocks
which had no water and no conveniences; they lay on straw mattresses
on the ground, so closely pressed together that one was quite
unable to pass between them. At night one could not sleep because
of the continuous coming and going, and the internees trod on each
other when passing. The straw mattresses were rotten and teemed
with lice; those who were able to stand remained for hours on end
for roll call until they collapsed. In February their coats were taken
away but they continued to stay out for roll call and mortality was
considerably increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of nourishment they received only one thin slice of bread
and half a quart of swede soup, and all the drink they got in 24
hours was half a quart of herbal tea. They had no water to drink,
none to wash in, and none to wash their mess tins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Jugendlager there was also a Revier for those who could
no longer stand. Periodically, during the roll calls, the Aufseherin
would choose some internees, who would be undressed and left in
nothing but their chemises. Their coats were then returned to them.
They were hoisted on to a truck and were driven off to the gas
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
chamber. A few days later the coats were returned to the Kammer
(the clothing warehouse), and the labels were marked “Mittwerda.”
The internees working on the labels told us that the word “Mittwerda”
did not exist and that it was a special term for the gases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Revier white powder was periodically distributed, and the
sick were dying as in Block 10, which I mentioned a short time ago.
They made .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The details of the witness’ evidence as to
Ravensbrück seem to be very much like, if not the same, as at Auschwitz.
Would it not be possible now, after hearing this amount of
detail, to deal with the matter more generally, unless there is some
substantial difference between Ravensbrück and Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I think there is a difference which the witness has
pointed out to us, namely, that in Auschwitz the prisoners were
purely and simply exterminated. It was merely an extermination
camp, whereas at Ravensbrück they were interned in order to work,
and were weakened by work until they died of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If there are any other distinctions between
the two, no doubt you will lead the witness, I mean ask the witness
about those other distinctions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall not fail to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>To the witness.</span>] Could you tell the Tribunal in what condition
the men’s camp was found at the time of the liberation and how
many survivors remained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: When the Germans went away
they left 2,000 sick women and a certain number of volunteers, myself
included, to take care of them. They left us without water and
without light. Fortunately the Russians arrived on the following
day. We therefore were able to go to the men’s camp and there we
found a perfectly indescribable sight. They had been for 5 days
without water. There were 800 serious cases, and three doctors and
seven nurses, who were unable to separate the dead from the sick.
Thanks to the Red Army, we were able to take these sick persons
over into clean blocks and to give them food and care; but unfortunately
I can give the figures only for the French. There were
400 of them when we came to the camp and only 150 were able to
return to France; for the others it was too late, in spite of all
our care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you present at any of the executions and do
you know how they were carried out in the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I was not present at the executions.
I only know that the last one took place on 22 April, 8 days
before the arrival of the Red army. The prisoners were sent, as I
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
said, to the Kommandantur; then their clothes were returned and
their cards were removed from the files.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was the situation in this camp of an exceptional
nature or do you consider it was part of a system?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: It is difficult to convey an
exact idea of the concentration camps to anybody, unless one has
been in the camp oneself, since one can only quote examples of horror;
but it is quite impossible to convey any impression of that deadly
monotony. If asked what was the worst of all, it is impossible to
answer, since everything was atrocious. It is atrocious to die of
hunger, to die of thirst, to be ill, to see all one’s companions dying
around one and being unable to help them. It is atrocious to think
of one’s children, of one’s country which one will never see again, and
there were times when we asked whether our life was not a living
nightmare, so unreal did this life appear in all its horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For months, for years we had one wish only: The wish that some
of us would escape alive, in order to tell the world what the Nazi
convict prisons were like everywhere, at Auschwitz as at Ravensbrück.
And the comrades from the other camps told the same tale;
there was the systematic and implacable urge to use human beings
as slaves and to kill them when they could work no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Have you anything further to relate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thank you. If the Tribunal wishes to question the
witness, I have finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I have no questions to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANNS MARX (Acting for Dr. Babel, Counsel for the SS):
Attorney Babel was prevented from coming this morning as he has
to attend a conference with General Mitchell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lords, I should like to take the liberty of asking the witness
a few questions to elucidate the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Madame Couturier, you declared that
you were arrested by the French police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: For what reason were you arrested?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Resistance. I belonged to a
resistance movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Another question: Which position did you occupy?
I mean what kind of post did you ever hold? Have you ever held
a post?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Where?
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: For example as a teacher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Before the war? I don’t quite
see what this question has to do with the matter. I was a journalist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. The fact of the matter is that you, in your
statement, showed great skill in style and expression; and I should
like to know whether you held any position such, for example, as
teacher or lecturer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: No. I was a newspaper photographer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How do you explain that you yourself came through
these experiences so well and are now in such a good state of health?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: First of all, I was liberated a
year ago; and in a year one has time to recover. Secondly, I was
10 months in quarantine for typhus and I had the great luck not
to die of exanthematic typhus, although I had it and was ill for 3½
months. Also, in the last months at Ravensbrück, as I knew German,
I worked on the Revier roll call, which explains why I did not have
to work quite so hard or to suffer from the inclemencies of the
weather. On the other hand, out of 230 of us only 49 from my
convoy returned alive; and we were only 52 at the end of 4 months.
I had the great fortune to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. Does your statement contain what you yourself
observed or is it concerned with information from other sources
as well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Whenever such was the case I
mentioned it in my declaration. I have never quoted anything which
has not previously been verified at the sources and by several persons,
but the major part of my evidence is based on personal experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How can you explain your very precise statistical
knowledge, for instance, that 700,000 Jews arrived from Hungary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I told you that I have worked
in the offices; and where Auschwitz was concerned, I was a friend of
the secretary (the Oberaufseherin), whose name and address I gave
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: It has been stated that only 350,000 Jews came from
Hungary, according to the testimony of the Chief of the Gestapo,
Eichmann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I am not going to argue with
the Gestapo. I have good reasons to know that what the Gestapo
states is not always true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How were you treated personally? Were you
treated well?
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: Like the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Like the others? You said before that the German
people must have known of the happenings in Auschwitz. What are
your grounds for this statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I have already told you: To
begin with there was the fact that, when we left, the Lorraine soldiers
of the Wehrmacht who were taking us to Auschwitz said to us,
“If you knew where you were going, you would not be in such a
hurry to get there.” Then there was the fact that the German women
who came out of quarantine to go to work in German factories knew
of these events, and they all said that they would speak about them
outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further, the fact that in all the factories where the Häftlinge (the
internees) worked they were in contact with the German civilians,
as also were the Aufseherinnen, who were in touch with their friends
and families and often told them what they had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: One more question. Up to 1942 you were able to
observe the behavior of the German soldiers in Paris. Did not these
German soldiers behave well throughout and did they not pay for
what they took?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MME. VAILLANT-COUTURIER: I have not the least idea
whether they paid or not for what they requisitioned. As for their
good behavior, too many of my friends were shot or massacred for
me not to differ with you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I have no further question to put to this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Dr. Marx started to leave the lectern and then returned.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you have no further question there is nothing
more to be said. [<span class='it'>Laughter.</span>] There is too much laughter in the
court; I have already spoken about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>To Dr. Marx.</span>] I thought you had said you had no further
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. Please excuse me. I only want to make a
proviso for Attorney Babel that he might cross-examine the witness
himself at a later date, if that is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Babel, did you say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon; yes, certainly. When will
Dr. Babel be back in his place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I presume that he will be back in the afternoon. He
is in the building. However, he must first read the minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will consider the question. If Dr. Babel
is here this afternoon we will consider the matter, if Dr. Babel makes
a further application.
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Does any other of the defendants’ counsel wish to ask any questions
of the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Dubost, have you any questions you wish to ask on reexamination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness may retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If the Tribunal will kindly allow it, we shall now
hear another witness, M. Veith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you calling this witness on the treatment
of prisoners in concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Mr. President, and also because this witness
can give us particulars of the ill-treatment to which certain prisoners
of war had been exposed in the camps of internees. This is no longer
a question of concentration camps and of ill-treatment inflicted upon
civilians in those camps, but of soldiers who had been brought to the
concentration camps and subjected to the same cruelty as the civilian
prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you won’t lose sight of the fact that
there has been practically no cross-examination of the witnesses you
have already called about the treatment in concentration camps?
The Tribunal, I think, feels that you could deal with the treatment
in concentration camps somewhat more generally than the last witness.
Do you hear what I say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that you could deal with
the question of treatment in concentration camps rather more generally
now, since we have heard the details from the witnesses whom
you have already called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Veith, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is the Tribunal willing to hear this witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>To the witness.</span>] What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. JEAN-FRÉDÉRIC VEITH (Witness): Jean-Frédéric Veith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath: I swear that I will
speak without hate or fear, that I will tell the truth, all the truth,
nothing but the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raise your right hand and say, “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I swear it.
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you like to sit down and spell your
name and surname?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you please spell your name and surname?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: J-e-a-n F-r-é-d-é-r-i-c V-e-i-t-h. I was born on 28 April
1903 in Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are of French nationality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I am of French nationality, born of French parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In which camp were you interned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: At Mauthausen; from 22 April 1943 until 22 April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You knew about the work carried out in the factories
supplying material to the Luftwaffe. Who controlled these
factories?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I was in the Arbeitseinsatz at Mauthausen from June
1943, and I was therefore well acquainted with all questions dealing
with the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who controlled the factories working for the Luftwaffe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: There were outside camps at Mauthausen where workers
were employed by Heinkel, Messerschmidt, Alfa-Vienne, and the
Saurer-Werke, and there was, moreover, the construction work on
the Leibl Pass tunnel by the Alpine Montan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who controlled this work, supervisors or
engineers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: There was only SS supervision. The work itself was
controlled by the engineers and the firms themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did these engineers belong to the Luftwaffe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: On certain days I saw Luftwaffe officers who came to
visit the Messerschmidt workshops in the quarry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were they able to see for themselves the conditions
under which the prisoners lived?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you see any high-ranking Nazi officials visiting
the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I saw a great many high-ranking officials, among them
Himmler, Kaltenbrunner, Pohl, Maurer, the Chief of the Labor
Office, Amt D II, of the Reich, and many other visitors whose names
I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who told you that Kaltenbrunner had come?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Well, our offices faced the parade ground overlooking
the Kommandantur; we therefore saw the high-ranking officials
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
arriving, and the SS men themselves would tell us, “There goes so
and so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Could the civilian population know, and did it
know of the plight of the internees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Yes, the population could know, since at Mauthausen
there was a road near the quarry and those who passed by that
road could see all that was happening. Moreover, the internees
worked in the factories. They were separated from the other workers,
but they had certain contacts with them and it was quite easy
for the other workers to realize their plight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you tell us what you know about a journey,
to an unknown castle, of a bus carrying prisoners who were never
seen again?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: At one time a method for the elimination of sick persons
by injections was adopted at Mauthausen. It was particularly
used by Dr. Krebsbach, nicknamed “Dr. Spritzbach” by the prisoners
since it was he who had inaugurated the system of injections.
There came a time when the injections were discontinued, and then
persons who were too sick or too weak were sent to a castle which,
we learned later, was called Hartheim, but was officially known
as a Genesungslager (convalescent camp). Of all of those who went
there, none ever returned. We received the death certificates
directly from the political section of the camp; these certificates
were secret. Everybody who went to Hartheim died. The number
of dead amounted to about 5,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you see prisoners of war arrive at Mauthausen
Camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Certainly I saw prisoners of war. Their arrival at Mauthausen
Camp took place, first of all, in front of the political section.
Since I was working at the Hollerith I could watch the arrivals,
for the offices faced the parade ground in front of the political
section where the convoys arrived. The convoys were immediately
sorted out. One part was sent to the camp for registration, and
very often some of the uniformed prisoners were set aside; these
had already been subjected to special violence in the political section
and were handed straight over to the prison guards. They were
then sent to the prisons and never heard of again. They were not
registered in the camp. The only registration was made in the
political section by Müller who was in charge of these prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They were prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: They were prisoners of war. They were very often in
uniform.
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Of what nationality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Mostly Russians and Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They were brought to your camp to be killed
there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: They were brought to our camp for “Action K.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What do you know about Action K and how do
you know it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: My knowledge of Action K is due to the fact that I was
head of the Hollerith service in Mauthausen, and consequently
received all the transfer forms from the various camps. And when
prisoners were erroneously transferred to us as ordinary prisoners,
we would put it on the transfer form which we had to send to the
central office in Berlin, or rather, we would not put any number
at all, as we were unable to give one. The “Politische” gave us no
indications at all and even destroyed the list of names if, by chance,
it ever reached us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conversations with my comrades of the “Politische” I discovered
that this Action K was originally applied to prisoners of war who
had been captured while attempting to escape. Later this action
was extended further still, but always to soldiers and especially to
officers who had succeeded in escaping but who had been recaptured
in countries under German control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, any person engaged in activities which might be interpreted
as not corresponding to the wishes of the fascist chiefs could
also be subjected to Action K. These prisoners arrived at Mauthausen
and disappeared, that is, they were taken to the prison
where one part would be executed on the spot and another sent to
the annex of the prison, which by this time had become too small
to hold them, to the famous Block 20 of Mauthausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You definitely state that these were prisoners
of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Yes, they were prisoners of war, most of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know of an execution of officers, prisoners
of war, who had been brought to the camp at Mauthausen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I cannot give you any names, but there were some.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you witness the execution of Allied officers
who were murdered within 48 hours of their arrival in camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I saw the arrival of the convoy of 6 September. I
believe that is the one you are thinking of; I saw the arrival of this
convoy and in the very same afternoon these 47 went down to the
quarry dressed in nothing but their shirts and drawers. Shortly
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
after we heard the sound of machine gun fire. I then left the office
and passed at the back, pretending I was carrying documents to
another office, and with my own eyes I saw these unfortunate
people shot down; 19 were executed on the very same afternoon
and the remainder on the following morning. Later on, all the
death certificates were marked, “Killed while attempting to escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you have the names?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Yes, I have a copy of the names of these prisoners.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: If the Court please, it is desired to announce that
the Defendant Kaltenbrunner will be absent from this afternoon’s
session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may go on, M. Dubost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We are going to complete the hearing of the
witness Veith, to whom, however, I have only one more question
to put.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have him brought in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Veith, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You continue to testify under the oath that you
already made this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you give some additional information concerning the
execution of the 47 Allied officers whom you saw shot in 48 hours
at Camp Mauthausen where they had been brought?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Those officers, those parachutists, were shot in
accordance with the usual systems used whenever prisoners had to
be done away with. That is to say, they were forced to work to
excess, to carry heavy stones. Then they were beaten until they
took heavier ones; and so on and so forth until, finally driven to
extremity, they turned towards the barbed wire. If they did not do
it of their own accord, they were pushed there; and they were
beaten until they did so; and the moment they approached it and
were perhaps about one meter away from it, they were mown down
by machine guns fired by the SS guards in the watchtowers. This
was the usual system for the “killing for attempted escape” as they
afterwards called it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those 47 men were killed on the afternoon of the 6th and
morning of the 7th of September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How did you know their names?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Their names came to me with the official list, because
they had all been entered in the camp registers and I had to report
to Berlin all the changes in the actual strength of the Hollerith
Section. I saw all the rosters of the dead and of the new arrivals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you communicate this list to an official
authority?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: This list was taken by the American official authorities
when I was at Mauthausen. I immediately went back to Mauthausen
after my liberation, because I knew where the documents were; and
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
the American authorities then had all the lists which we were able
to find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I have no further questions to ask
the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the British Prosecutor want to ask any
questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BRITISH PROSECUTOR: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the United States Prosecutor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>UNITED STATES PROSECUTOR: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any members of the Defense Counsel wish
to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I am the defense counsel for the SS and SD.
Mr. President, I was in the Dachau Camp on Saturday and at the
Augsburg-Göggingen Camp yesterday. I found out various things
there which now enable me to question individual witnesses. I
could not do this before, as I was not acquainted with local
conditions. I should like to put one question. I was unable to
attend here this morning on account of a conference to which I was
called by General Mitchell. Consequently I did not have the cross-examination
of the witness this morning. I have only one question
to put to the witness now. I should like to ask whether I may
cross-examine the witness further later, or if it is better to
withdraw the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can cross-examine this witness now, but
the Tribunal is informed that you left General Mitchell at
15 minutes past 10.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Yes, but as a consequence of the conference I
had to send a telegram and dispatch some other pressing business
so that it was impossible for me to attend the session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can certainly cross-examine the witness
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I have only one more question, namely: The
witness stated that the officers in question were driven toward the
wire fence. By whom were they so driven?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: They were driven to the barbed wire by the SS guards
who accompanied them, and the entire Mauthausen staff was
present. They were also beaten by the SS and by one or two
“green” prisoners, who were with them and who were the “Kapo.”
In the camps these “green” prisoners were often worse than the SS
themselves.
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Thus, in the Dachau Camp, inside the camp
itself, within the wire enclosure, there were almost no SS guards,
and that was probably also the case in Mauthausen? However .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Inside the camp there was only a limited number of SS,
but they changed, and none of those who belonged to the troops
guarding the camp could fail to be aware of what went on in it;
even if they did not enter the camp, they watched it from the
watchtowers and from outside, and they saw precisely everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Were the guards who shot at the prisoners inside
or outside the wire enclosure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: They were in the watchtowers in the same line as the
barbed wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Could they see from there that the officers were
driven to the barbed wire by anyone by means of blows? Could
they observe that they were driven there and beaten?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: They could see it so well that once or twice some of the
guards refused to shoot, saying that it was not an attempt to escape
and they would not shoot. They were immediately relieved from
their posts, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Did you see that yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I did not see it myself, but I heard about it; it was told
by my Kommandoführer among others, who said to me, “There’s a
watchguard who refused to shoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Who was this Kommandoführer? The chief of
the group?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: The Kommandoführer was Wielemann. I do not
remember his rank. He was not Unterscharführer, but the rank
immediately below Unterscharführer, and he was in charge of the
Hollerith section in Mauthausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no more questions to ask just now. I shall, however, make
application to call the witness again, and I shall then take the
opportunity to ask the rest, to put such further questions to him as
I consider necessary. I request you to retain him for this purpose,
here in Nuremberg. I am not in a position to cross-examine the
witness this afternoon, as I did not hear his statements this morning,
and I would request that the witness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You ought to have been here. If you were
released from an interview with General Mitchell at 10:15, there
seems to the Tribunal, to me at any rate, to be no reason why you
should not have been here while this witness was being examined.
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Mr. President, this morning I discussed with
General Mitchell some questions with which I have been occupied
for a long time. General Mitchell agreed in the course of our
conversation that my duties and activities are so extensive that it
will now be necessary to appoint a second defense counsel for the
SS; my presence at the sessions claims so much of my working time
and has become so exhausting and so burdensome that I am often
compelled to be absent from the Court. I am sorry, but in the
prevailing circumstances, I cannot help it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further, I would like to say this: So far, over 40,000 members of
the SS have made applications to the Tribunal; and although many
of these are collective and not individual applications, you can
imagine how wide the field is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, no doubt your work is extensive, but
this morning, as I have already told you, General Mitchell has
informed the Tribunal that his interview with you finished at 10:15;
and it appears to the Tribunal that you must have known that the
witnesses who were giving evidence this morning were giving
evidence about concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to that, you had obtained the assistance of another
counsel, I think, Dr. Marx, to appear on your behalf, and he did
appear on your behalf; and he will have an opportunity of cross-examining
this witness if he wishes to do so now. The Tribunal
considers that you must conclude your cross-examination of this
witness now. I mean to say, you may ask any further questions of
the witness that you wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: It all amounts to whether I can put a question,
and this I cannot do at the moment; therefore, I must renounce
the cross-examination of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are there any other questions to put,
M. Dubost? There may be some other German counsel who wish to
cross-examine this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Dubost, do you wish to address the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your Honor, I would like to state to the Tribunal
that we have no reason whatsoever to fear a cross-examination of
our witness or of this morning’s witness, at any time; and we are
ready to ask our witnesses to stay in Nuremberg as long as may be
necessary to reply to any questions from the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, in view of the offer of the French
Prosecutor to keep the witness in Nuremberg, the Tribunal will
allow you to put any questions you wish to put to him in the course
of the next 2 days. Do you understand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KURT KAUFFMANN (Counsel for Defendant Kaltenbrunner):
Before I question the witness, I allow myself to raise one
point which, I believe, will have an important influence on the good
progress of the proceedings. The point I wish to raise is the
following, and I speak in the name of my colleagues as well: Would
it not be well to come to an agreement that both the Prosecution
and the Defense be informed the day before a witness is brought in,
which witness is to be heard? The material has now become so
considerable that circumstances make it impossible to ask pertinent
questions, questions which are urgently necessary in the interest of
all parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the Defense is concerned, we are ready to inform the
Tribunal and the Prosecution of the witnesses we intend to ask for
examination, at least one day before they are to be heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has already expressed its wish
that they should be informed beforehand of the witnesses who are
to be called and upon what subject. I hope that Counsel for the
Prosecution will take note of this wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Yes, I thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A point of special significance emerges from the statements of
the witness we heard this morning, as well as from the statements
of this witness; and this point concerns something which may be of
decisive importance for the Trial as a whole. The Prosecution .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are not here to make a speech at the
moment. You are to ask the witness questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Yes. It is the question of the responsibility
of the German people. The witness has stated that the civilian
population was in a position to know what was going on. I shall
now try to ascertain the truth by means of a series of questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did civilians look on when executions took place? Would you
answer this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: They could see the corpses scattered along the roads
when the prisoners were shot while returning in convoys, and
corpses were even thrown from the trains. And they could always
take note of the emaciated condition of these prisoners who worked
outside, because they saw them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Do you know that it was forbidden on pain
of death to say anything outside the camp about the atrocities,
anything in the way of cruelties, torture, et cetera, that took place
inside?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: As I spent 2 years in the camp I saw them. Some of
them I saw myself, and the rest were described to me by eyewitnesses.
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Could you please repeat that again? Did you
see the secrecy order? What did you see?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Not the order, I saw the execution and that is worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: My question was this: Do you know that the
strictest orders were given to the SS personnel, to the executioners,
et cetera, not to speak even inside the camp, much less outside of it,
of the atrocities that went on and that eyewitnesses who spoke of
them rendered themselves liable to the most rigorous penalties,
including the death penalty? Do you know anything about that,
about such a practice inside the camps? Perhaps you will tell me
whether you yourself were allowed to talk about any observations
of the kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: I know that liberated prisoners had to sign a statement
saying that they would never reveal what had happened in the
camp and that they had to forget what had happened; but those
who were in contact with the population, and there were many of
them, did not fail to talk about it. Furthermore, Mauthausen was
situated on a hill. There was a crematorium, which emitted flames
3 feet high. When you see flames 3 feet high coming out of a
chimney every night, you are bound to wonder what it is; and
everyone must have known that it was a crematorium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I have no further question. Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other counsel for the defendants
wish to ask any questions? Did you tell us who the “green prisoners”
were? You mentioned “green prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VEITH: Yes, these “green prisoners” were prisoners convicted
under the common law. They were used by the SS to police the
camps. As I have already said, they were often more bestial than
the SS themselves and acted as their executioners. They did the
work with which the SS did not wish to soil their hands; they were
doing all the dirty work, but always by order of the Kommandoführer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This contact with the “green” Germans was terrible for the
internees, particularly for the political internees. They could not
bear the sight of them, because they realized that we were not their
sort, and they persecuted us for that alone. It was the same in all
the camps. In all the camps we were bullied by the German
criminals serving with the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, do you wish to ask any other
question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your Honor, I have no more questions to ask.
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall request the Tribunal to authorize us to hear
the French witness, Dr. Dupont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Dupont, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is your name Dr. Dupont?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VICTOR DUPONT (Witness): Dupont, Victor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me? I swear
that I will speak without hate or fear, that I will tell the truth, all
the truth, nothing but the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raise your right hand and say, “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your name is Victor Dupont?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Yes, I am called Victor Dupont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were born on 12 December 1909?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: At Charmes in the Vosges?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are of French nationality, born of French
parents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You have won honorable distinctions. What are
they?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I have the Legion of Honor, I am a Chevalier of the
Legion of Honor. I have 2 Army citations, and I have the Resistance
Medal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you deported to Buchenwald?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I was deported to Buchenwald on 24 January 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You stayed there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I stayed there 15 months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Until 20 May 1945?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: No, until 20 April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you make your statement on the regime in
the concentration camp where you were interned and the aim of
those who prescribed this regime?
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: When I arrived at Buchenwald I soon became aware
of the difficult living conditions. The regime imposed upon the
prisoners was not based on any principle of justice. The principle
which formed the basis of this regime was the principle of the
purge. I will explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We—I am speaking of the French—were grouped together at
Buchenwald almost all of us, without having been tried by any
Tribunal. In 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945, it was quite unusual to pass
any formal judgment on the prisoners. Many of us were interrogated
and then deported; others were cleared by the interrogation and
deported all the same. Others again were not interrogated at all. I
shall give you three examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 November 1943 elements estimated at several hundred
persons were arrested at Grenoble during a demonstration commemorating
the Armistice. They were brought to Buchenwald,
where the greater part died. The same thing happened in the village
of Verchenie (Drôme) in October 1943. I saw them at Buchenwald
too. It happened again in April 1944 at St. Claude, and I saw
these people brought in in August 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way, various elements were assembled at Buchenwald
subject to martial law. But there were also all kinds of people,
including some who were obviously innocent, who had either been
cleared by interrogation or not even interrogated at all. Finally,
there were some political prisoners. They had been deported because
they were members of parties which were to be suppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That does not mean that the interrogations were not to be taken
seriously. The interrogations which I underwent and which I saw
others undergo were particularly inhuman. I shall enumerate a few
of the methods:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every imaginable kind of beating, immersion in bathtubs, squeezing
of testicles, hanging, crushing of the head in iron bands, and
the torturing of entire families in each other’s sight. I have, in
particular, seen a wife tortured before her husband; and children
were tortured before their mothers. For the sake of precision, I will
quote one name: Francis Goret of the Rue de Bourgogne in Paris
was tortured before his mother. Once in the camp, conditions were
the same for everyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You spoke of racial purging as a social policy.
What was the criterion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: At Buchenwald various elements described as “political,”
“national”—mainly Jews and Gypsies—and “asocial”—especially
criminals—were herded together under the same regime. There
were criminals of every nation: Germans, Czechs, Frenchmen, et
cetera, all living together under the same regime. A purge does
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
not necessarily imply extermination, but this purge was achieved
by means of the extermination already mentioned. It began for us
in certain cases; the decision was taken quite suddenly. I shall give
one example. In 1944 a convoy of several hundred Gypsy children
arrived at Buchenwald, by what administrative mystery we never
knew. They were assembled during the winter of 1944 and were
to be sent on to Auschwitz to be gassed. One of the most tragic
memories of my deportation is the way in which these children,
knowing perfectly well what was in store for them, were driven
into the vans, screaming and crying. They went on to Auschwitz
the same day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other cases the extermination was carried out by progressive
stages. It had already begun when the convoy arrived. For instance,
in the French convoy which left Compiègne on 24 January 1944 and
arrived on 26 January, I saw one van containing 100 persons, of
which 12 were dead and 8 insane. During the period of my deportation
I saw numerous transports come in. The same thing happened
every time; only the numbers varied. In this way the elimination
of a certain proportion had already been achieved when the
convoy arrived. Then they were put in quarantine and exposed to
cold for several hours, while roll call was taken. The weaker died.
Then came extermination through work. Some of them were picked
out and sent to Kommandos such as Dora, S III, and Laura. I
noticed that after those departures, which took place every month,
when the contingent was brought up to strength again, truck-loads
of dead were brought back to Buchenwald. I even attended the
post-mortems on them, and I can tell you the results. The lesions
were those of a very advanced stage of cachexy. Those who had
stood up to conditions for one, two, or three months very often
exhibited the lesions characteristic of acute tuberculosis, mostly of
the granular type. In Buchenwald itself prisoners had to work; and
there, as everywhere else, the only hope of survival lay in work.
Extermination in Buchenwald was carried out in accordance with a
principle of selection laid down by the medical officer in charge,
Dr. Shiedlauski. These selections .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Excuse me for interrupting. What is the nationality
of this medical officer in charge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: He was a German SS doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Are you sure of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Yes, I am quite sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Are you testifying as an eyewitness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I am testifying as an eyewitness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Go on, please.
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Shiedlauski carried out the selection and picked out
the sick and invalids. Prior to January 1945 they were sent to
Auschwitz; later on they went to Bergen-Belsen. None of them ever
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another case which I witnessed concerns a Jewish labor squad
which was sent to Auschwitz and stayed there several months.
When they came back, they were unfit for even the lighter work.
A similar fate overtook them. They also were sent to Auschwitz
again. I myself personally witnessed these things. I was present
at the selection and I witnessed their departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, the executions in Buchenwald took place in the camp
itself. To my own knowledge they began in September 1944 in
room 7, a little room in the Revier. The men were done away with
by means of inter-cardiac injections. The output was not great; it
did not exceed a few score a day, at the most.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on more and more convoys came in, and the number of
cachexy cases increased. The executions had to be speeded up. At
first they were carried out as soon as the transports arrived; but
from January 1945 onwards they were taken care of in a special
block, Block 61. At that date all those nicknamed “Mussulmans”
on account of their appearance were collected in this block. We
never saw them without their blankets over their shoulders. They
were unfit for even the lightest work. They all had to go through
Block 61. The death toll varied daily from a minimum of 10 to
about 200 in Block 61. The execution was performed by injecting
phenol into the heart in the most brutal manner. The bodies were
then carted to the crematorium mostly during roll calls or at night.
Finally, extermination was also always assured at the end by convoys.
The convoys which left Buchenwald while the Allies were
advancing were used to assure extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give an example: At the end of March 1945 elements withdrawn
from the S III detachment arrived at Buchenwald. They
were in a state of complete exhaustion when they arrived and
quite unfit for any kind of exertion. They were the first to be
re-expedited, two days after their arrival. It was only about half
a mile from their starting point in the small camp, that is, at the
back of the Buchenwald Camp, to their point of assembly for roll
call; and to give you an idea of the state of weakness in which
these people were, I need only say that between this starting point
and their assembly point, that is, over a distance of half a mile,
we saw 60 of them collapse and die. They could not go on further.
Most of them died very soon, in a few hours or in the course of the
next day. So much for the systematic extermination which I witnessed
in Buchenwald, including .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What about those who were left?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Those who were left when the last convoy went out?
That is a complicated story. We were deeply grieved about them.
About the 1st of April, though I cannot guarantee the exact date,
the commander of the camp, Pister, assembled a large number of
prisoners and addressed them as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Allied advance has already reached the immediate
neighborhood of Buchenwald. I wish to hand over to the
Allies the keys of the camp. I do not want any atrocities.
I wish the camp as a whole to be handed over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of actual fact, the Allied advance was held up,
more than we wanted at least, and evacuation was begun. A delegation
of prisoners went to see the commander, reminding him of
his word, for he had given his word emphasizing that it was his
“word of honor as a soldier.” He seemed acutely embarrassed and
explained that Sauckel, the Governor of Thuringia, had given orders
that no prisoner should remain in Buchenwald, for that constituted
a danger to the province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, we knew that all who knew the secrets of the
administration of Buchenwald Camp would be put out of the way.
A few days before we were liberated 43 of our comrades belonging
to different nationalities were called out to be done away with, and
an unusual phenomenon occurred. The camp revolted; the men
were hidden and never given up. We also knew that under no circumstances
would anyone who had been employed, either in the
experimental block or in the infirmary, be allowed to leave the
camp. That is all I have to say about the last few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This officer in command of the camp, whom you
have just said gave his word of honor as a soldier, was he a soldier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: His attitude towards the prisoners was ruthless; but
he had his orders. Frankly, he was a particular type of soldier; but
he was not acting on his own initiative in treating the prisoners in
this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: To what branch of the service did he belong?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: He belonged to the SS Totenkopf Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was he an SS man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Yes, he was an SS man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: He was acting on orders, you say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: He was certainly acting on orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: For what purposes were the prisoners used?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The prisoners were used in such a way that no attention
was paid to the fact that they were human beings. They were
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
used for experimental purposes. At Buchenwald the experiments
were made in Block 46. The men who were to be employed there
were always selected by means of a medical examination. On those
occasions when I was present it was performed by Dr. Shiedlauski,
of whom I have already spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was he a doctor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Yes, he was a doctor. The internees were used for
the hardest labor; in the Laura mines, working in the salt mines
as, for instance, in the Mansleben-am-See Kommando, clearing up
bomb debris. It must be remembered that the more difficult the
labor conditions were, the harsher was the supervision by the
guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The internees were used in Buchenwald for any kind of labor;
in earth works, in quarries, and in factories. To cite a particular
case: There were two factories attached to Buchenwald, the Gustloff
works and the Mühlbach works. They were munition factories
under technical and non-military management. In this particular
case there was some sort of rivalry between the SS and the technical
management of the factory. The technical management, concerned
with its output, took the part of the prisoners to the extent
of occasionally obtaining supplementary rations for them. Internee
labor had certain advantages. The cost was negligible, and from a
security point of view the maximum of secrecy was ensured, as the
internees had no contact with the outside world and therefore no
leakage was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You mean leakage of military information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I mean leakage of military information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Could outsiders see that the internees were ill-treated
and wretched?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: That is another question, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you answer it later?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I shall answer it later. I have omitted one detail.
The internees were also used to a certain extent after death. The
ashes resulting from the cremations were thrown into the excrement
pit and served to fertilize the fields around Buchenwald. I add
this detail because it struck me vividly at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, as I said, work, whatever it might be, was the internees’
only chance of survival. As soon as they were no longer of
any possible use, they were done for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were not internees used as “blood donors,” involuntary
of course?
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I forgot that point. Prisoners assigned to light work,
whose output was poor, were used as blood donors. Members of the
Wehrmacht came several times. I saw them twice at Buchenwald,
taking blood from these men. The blood was taken in a ward
known as CP-2, that is, Operation Ward 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This was done on orders from higher quarters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I do not see how it could have been done otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: On their own initiative?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Not on the initiative of anyone in the camp. These
elements had nothing to do with the camp administration or the
guards. I must make it clear that those whom I saw belonged to
the Wehrmacht, whereas we were guarded by SS, all of them from
the Totenkopf Division. Towards the end, a special use was made
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early months of 1945, members of the Gestapo came to
Buchenwald and took away all the papers of those who had died, in
order to re-establish their identity and to make out forged papers.
One Jew was specially employed to touch up photographs and to
adapt the papers which had belonged to the dead for the use of
persons whom, of course, we did not know. The Jew disappeared,
and I do not know what became of him. We never saw him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this utilization of identification papers was not confined to
the dead. Several hundred French internees were summoned to the
“Fliegerverwaltung” and there subjected to a very precise interrogation
on their person, their connections, their convictions, and
their background. They were then told that they would on no
account be allowed to receive any correspondence, or even parcels—those
of them who ever received any. From an administrative point
of view all traces of them were effaced and contact with the outside
world was rendered even more impossible for them than it had
been under ordinary circumstances. We were deeply concerned
about the fate of these comrades. We were liberated very soon
after that, and I can only say that prisoners were used in this way,
that their identification papers were used for manufacturing forged
documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the effect of this kind of life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The effect of this kind of life on the human organism?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: On the human organism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: As to the human organism, there was only one effect:
the degradation of the human being. The living conditions which
I have just described were enough in themselves to produce such
degradation. It was done systematically. An unrelenting will seemed
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
to be at work to reduce those men to the same level, the lowest
possible level of human degradation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To begin with, the first degrading factor was the way in which
they were mixed. It was permissible to mix nationalities, but not
to mix indiscriminately every possible type of prisoner: political,
military—for the members of the French resistance movement were
soldiers—racial elements, and common-law criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Criminals of all nationalities were herded together with their
compatriots, and every nationality lived side by side, so conditions
of living were distressing. In addition, there was overcrowding,
unsanitary conditions, and compulsory labor. I shall give a few
examples to show that prisoners were mixed quite indiscriminately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March 1944, I saw the French General Duval die. He had
been working on the “terrasse” with me all day. When we came
back, he was covered with mud and completely exhausted. He died
a few hours later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French General Vernaud died on a straw mattress, filthy
with excrement, in room Number 6, where those on the verge of
death were taken, surrounded by dying men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw M. De Tessan die .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you explain to the Tribunal who M. De
Tessan was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: M. De Tessan was a former French minister, married
to an American. He also died on a straw mattress, covered with
pus, from a disease known as septicopyohemia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also witnessed the death of Count de Lipkowski, who had done
brilliant military service in this war. He had been granted the
honors of war by the German Army and had, for one thing, been
invited to Paris by Rommel, who desired to show the admiration
he felt for his military brilliance. He died miserably in the winter
of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One further instance: The Belgian Minister Janson was in the
camp living under the conditions which I have already described,
and of which you must have already heard very often. He died
miserably, a physical and mental wreck. His intellect had gone and
he had partially lost his reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cite only extreme cases and especially those of generals, as they
were said to be granted special conditions. I saw no sign of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last stage in this process of the degradation of human beings
was the setting of internee against internee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Before dealing with this point, will you describe
the conditions in which you found your former professor, Léon Kindberg,
professor of medicine?
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I studied medicine under Professor Maurice Léon
Kindberg at the Beaujon Hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In Paris?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Yes, in Paris. A very highly cultured and brilliantly
intelligent man. In January 1945 I learned that he had just arrived
from Monovitz. I found him in Block 58, a block which in normal
circumstances would hold 300 men, and into which 1,200 had been
crowded—Hungarians, Poles, Russians, Czechs, with a large proportion
of Jews in an extraordinary state of misery. I did not
recognize Léon Kindberg because there was nothing to distinguish
him from the usual type to be found in these blocks. There was no
longer any sign of intellect in him and it was hard to find anything
of the man that I had formerly known. We managed to get him
out of that block but his health was unfortunately too much impaired
and he died shortly after his liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you tell the Tribunal, as far as you know, the
“crimes” committed by this man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: After the armistice Léon Kindberg settled in Toulouse
to practice the treatment of pulmonary consumption. I know from
an absolutely reliable source that he had taken no part whatsoever
in activities directed against the German occupation authorities in
France. They found out that he was a Jew and as such he was
arrested and deported. He drifted into Buchenwald by way of
Auschwitz and Monovitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What crime had General Duval committed that he
should be imprisoned along with pimps, moral degenerates, and
murderers? What had General Vernaud done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I know nothing about the activities of General Duval
and General Vernaud during the occupation. All I can say is that
they were certainly not asocial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What about Count de Lipkowski and M. De Tessan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Nor has the Count de Lipkowski or M. De Tessan
committed any of the faults usually attributed to asocial elements
or common-law criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You may proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The means used to achieve the final degradation of
the internees as a whole was the torture of them by their fellow
prisoners. Let me give a particularly brutal instance. In Kommando
A. S. 6, which was situated at Mansleben-am-See, 70 kilometers from
Buchenwald, there were prisoners of every nationality, including a
large portion of Frenchmen. I had two friends there: Antoine
d’Aimery, a son of General d’Aimery, and Thibaut, who was studying
to become a missionary.
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Catholic?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Catholic. At Mansleben-am-See hangings took place
in public in the hall of a factory connected with the salt mine. The
SS were present at these hangings in full dress uniform, wearing
their decorations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners were forced to be present at these hangings under
threats of the most cruel beatings. When they hanged the poor
wretches, the prisoners had to give the Hitler salute. Worse still,
one prisoner was chosen to pull away the stool on which the victim
stood. He could not evade the order, as the consequences to himself
would have been too grave. When the execution had been
carried out, the prisoners had to file off in front of the victim between
two SS men. They were made to touch the body and, gruesome
detail, look the dead man in the eyes. I believe that men who had
been forced to go through such rites must inevitably lose the sense
of their dignity as human beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Buchenwald itself all the executive work was entrusted to
the internees, that is, the hangings were carried out by a German
prisoner assisted by other prisoners. The camp was policed by prisoners.
When someone in the camp was sentenced to death, it was
their duty to find him and take him to the place of execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selection for the labor squads, with which we were well
acquainted, especially for Dora, Laura, and S III—extermination
detachments—was carried out by prisoners, who decided which of
us were to go there. In this way the internees were forced down
to the worst possible level of degradation, inasmuch as every man
was forced to become the executioner of his fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already referred to Block 61, where the extermination of
the physically unfit and those otherwise unsuited for labor was
carried out. These executions were also carried out by prisoners
under SS supervision and control. From the point of view of
humanity in general, this was perhaps the worst crime of all, for
these men who were constrained to torture their fellow-beings have
now been restored to life, but profoundly changed. What is to
become of them? What are they going to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who was responsible for these crimes as far as your
personal knowledge goes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: One thing which strikes me as being particularly
significant is that the methods which I observed in Buchenwald now
appear to have been the same, or almost the same, as those prevailing
in all the other camps. The degree of uniformity in the way
in which the camps were run is clear evidence of orders from higher
quarters. In the case of Buchenwald, in particular, the personnel,
no matter how rough it might be, would not have done such things
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
on their own initiative. Moreover, the camp chief and the SS doctor,
himself, always pleaded superior orders, often in a vague manner.
The name most frequently invoked was that of Himmler. Other
names also were given. The chief medical officer for all the camps,
Lolling, was mentioned on numerous occasions in connection with
the extermination block, especially by an SS doctor in the camp,
named Bender. In regard to the selection of invalids or Jews to be
sent to Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen to be gassed, I heard the name
of Pohl mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What were the functions of Pohl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: He was chief of the SS administration in Berlin,
Division D 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Could the German people as a whole have been
in ignorance of these atrocities, or were they bound to know of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: As these camps had been in existence for years, it is
impossible for them not to have known. Our transport stopped at
Trèves on its way in. The prisoners in some vans were completely
naked while in others they were clothed. There was a crowd of
people around the station and they all saw the transport. Some of
them excited the SS men patrolling the platform. But there were
other channels through which information could reach the population.
To begin with, there were squads working outside the camps. Labor
squads went out from Buchenwald to Weimar, Erfurt, and Jena. They
left in the morning and came back at night, and during the day they
were among the civilian population. In the factories, too, the technical
crew were not members of the armed forces. The “Meister”
were not SS men. They went home every night after supervising
the work of the prisoners all day. Certain factories even employed
civilian labor—the Gustloff works in Weimar, for instance. During
the work, the internees and civilians were together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The civil authorities were responsible for victualling the camps
and were allowed to enter them, and I have seen civilian trucks
coming into the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The railway authorities were necessarily informed on those matters.
Numerous trains carried prisoners daily from one camp to
another; or from France to Germany; and these trains were driven
by railway men. Moreover, there was a regular daily train to
Buchenwald as a terminal station. The railway administrative
authorities must, therefore, have been well informed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Orders were also given in the factories, and industrialists could
not fail to be informed regarding the personnel they employed in
their factories. I may add that visits took place; the German prisoners
were sometimes visited. I knew certain German internees,
and I know that on the occasion of those visits they talked to their
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
relatives, which they could hardly do without informing their home
circle of what was going on. It would appear that it is impossible
to deny that the German people knew of the camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The Army knew of the camps. At least, this is what
I could observe. Every week so-called commissions came to Buchenwald,
a group of officers who came to visit the camp. There were
SS among these officers; but I very often saw members of the
Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, who came on those visits. Sometimes
we were able to identify the personalities who visited the camp,
rarely so far as I was concerned. On 22 March 1945 General Mrugowski
came to visit the camp. In particular, he spent a long time
in Block 61. He was accompanied on this visit by an SS general
and the chief medical officer of the camp, Dr. Shiedlauski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another point, during the last few months, the Buchenwald
guard, plus SS men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Excuse me for interrupting you. Could you tell us
about Block 61?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Block 61 was the extermination block for those suffering
from cachexy—in other words, those arrived in such a state
of exhaustion that they were totally unfit for work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is it direct testimony you are giving about this
visit to Block 61?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: This is from my own personal observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Whom does it concern?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: General Mrugowski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In the Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: A doctor and an SS general whom I cannot identify.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were university circles unaware of the work done
in the camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: At the Pathological Institute in Buchenwald, pathological
preparations were made; and naturally some of them were
out of the ordinary, since—and I am speaking as a doctor—we
encountered cases that can no longer be observed, cases such as
have been described in the books of the last century. Some excellent
pieces of work were prepared and sent to universities, especially
the University of Jena. On the other hand there were also
some exhibits which could not properly be described as anatomical.
Some prepared tattoo marks were sent to universities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you personally see that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I saw these tattoo marks prepared.
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Then how did they obtain the anatomic exhibits,
how did they get these tattoo marks? They waited for a natural
death, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The cases I observed were natural deaths or executions.
Before our arrival—and I can name witnesses who can
testify to this—they killed a man to get these tattoo marks. It
happened, I must emphasize, when I was not at Buchenwald. I am
repeating what was told me by witnesses whose names I will give.
During the period when the camp was commanded by Koch, people
who had particularly artistic tattoo marks were killed. The witness
I can refer to is a Luxembourger called Nicolas Simon who lives in
Luxembourg. He spent 6 years in Buchenwald in exceptional conditions
where he had unprecedented opportunities of observation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: But I am told that Koch was sentenced to death
and executed because of these excesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: As far as I know, Koch was mixed up with some sort
of swindling affair. He quarrelled with the SS administration. He
was undoubtedly arrested and imprisoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We had better have an adjournment now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We stopped at the end of the Koch story and the
witness was telling the Tribunal that Koch had been executed not
for the crimes that he had committed with regard to the internees
in his charge, but because of the numerous dishonest acts of which
he had been guilty during his period of service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did I understand the witness’ explanation correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I said explicitly that he had been accused of dishonesty.
I cannot give precise details of all the charges. I cannot
say that he was accused exclusively of dishonest acts by his administration;
I know that such charges were made against him, but I
have no further information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Have you nothing to add?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I can say that this information came from Dr. Owen,
who had been arrested at the same time and released again and
who returned to Buchenwald towards the end, that is, early in 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the nationality of this doctor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: German. He was in detention. He was an SS man
and Koch and he were arrested at the same time. Owen was released
and came back to Buchenwald restored to his rank and his functions
at the beginning of 1945. He was quite willing to talk to the prisoners
and the information that I have given comes from him.
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions to ask the witness,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any member of the Defense Counsel
wish to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: I am the Defense Counsel for the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, you previously stated that the methods of treatment in
Buchenwald were not peculiar to the Buchenwald Camp but must
be ascribed to a general order. The reasons you gave for this
statement were that you had seen those customs and methods in
all the other camps too. How am I to understand this expression
“in all the other camps”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I am speaking of concentration camps; to be precise,
a certain number of them, Mauthausen, Dachau, Sachsenhausen;
labor squads such as Dora, Laura, S III, Mansleben, Ebensee, to
mention these only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Were you yourself in those camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I myself went to Buchenwald. I collected exact
testimony about the other camps from friends who were there. In
any case, the number of friends of mine who died is a sufficiently
eloquent proof that extermination was carried out in the same way
in all the camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I should like to know to what block you
belonged. Perhaps you can tell the Tribunal—you have already
mentioned the point—how the prisoners were distributed? Did
they not also bear certain external markings, red patches on the
clothing of some and green on that of others?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: There were in fact a number of badges, all of which
were found in the same Kommandos. To give an example, where
I was—in the “terrassekommando” known as “Entwässerung”
(drainage)—I worked along side of German “common-laws” wearing
the green badge. Regarding the nationalities in this Kommando,
there were Russians, Czechs, Belgians, and French. Our badges
were different; our treatment was identical, and in this particular
case we were even commanded by “common-laws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I did not quite hear the beginning of your
answer. I asked whether the internees were divided into specific
categories identifiable externally by means of stars or some kind
of distinguishing mark: green, blue, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I said that there were various badges in the camp,
triangular badges which applied in principle to different categories,
but all the men were mixed up together, and subjected to the same
treatment.
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I did not ask you about their treatment, but
about the distinctive badges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: For the French it was a badge in the form of a shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: For all the prisoners, not only the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I am answering you. In the case of the French, who
were those I knew best, the red, political badge was given to
everyone without discrimination, including the prisoners brought
over from Fort Barraut, who were common-law criminals. I saw
the same thing among the Czechs and the Russians. It is true that
the use of different badges had been intended, but that was never
put into practice in any reasonable way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To come back to what I have already stated, even if there were
different badges, the people were all mixed up together, nevertheless,
and subjected exactly to the same treatment and the same
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: We have already heard several times that
prisoners of various nationalities were mixed up together. That is
not what I asked you. You were in the camp for a sufficiently long
period to be able to answer my question. How were these prisoners
divided? As far as I know, they were divided into criminal, political,
and other groups, and each group distinguished by a special sign
worn on the clothing—green, blue, red, or some other color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The use of different badges for different categories
had been planned. These categories were mixed up together.
“Criminals” were side by side with prisoners classed as “political.”
There were, however, blocks in which one or another of those
elements predominated; but they were not divided up into specific
groups distinguished by the particular badge they wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I have been told, for instance, that political
prisoners wore blue badges and the criminals wore red ones. We have
already had a witness who confirmed this to a certain extent by
stating that criminals wore a green badge and asocial offenders a
different badge and that the category to which they belonged could
be seen at a glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: It is true that different badges existed. It is true that
the use of these badges for different categories was foreseen; but
if I am to confine myself to the truth, I must emphasize the fact
that the full use was not made of these badges. For the French, in
particular, there were only political badges; and this increased the
confusion still more since notorious criminals from the ordinary
civil prisons were regarded everywhere as political prisoners. The
badges were intended to identify the different existing categories,
but they were not employed systematically. They were not
employed at all for the French prisoners.
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: If I understand you correctly, you say that all
French prisoners were classified as political prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Now, among these French prisoners, as you said
yourself, is it not true to say that there were not only political
prisoners but also a large proportion of criminals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: There were some among .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: At least, I took your previous statement to
mean that. You said that quite definitely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I did say so. I said that there were criminals from
special prisons who were not given the green badge with an F,
which they should have received, but the political badge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What was your employment in the camp? You
are a doctor, are you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I arrived in January. For 3 months I was assigned
first to the quarry and then to the “terrasse.” After that I was
assigned to the Revier, that is to say the camp infirmary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What were your duties there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I was assigned to the ambulance service for internal
diseases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Were you able to act on your own initiative?
What sort of instructions did you receive regarding the treatment
of patients?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: We acted under the control of an SS doctor. We had
a certain number of beds for certain patients, in the proportion of
one bed to 20 patients. We had practically no medical supplies.
I worked in the infirmary up to the liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Did you receive instructions regarding the
treatment of patients? Were you told to look after them properly
or were you given instructions to administer treatment which would
cause death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: As regards that, I was ordered to select the incurables
for extermination. I never carried out this order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Were you told to select them for extermination?
I did not quite hear your reply. Will you please repeat it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I was ordered to select those who were dangerously
ill so that they might be sent to Block 61 where they were to be
exterminated. That was the only order I received concerning the
patients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: “Where were they to be exterminated?” I asked
if you were told that they were to be selected for extermination.
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
Were you told—“They will be sent to Block 61?” Were you also
told what was to happen to them in Block 61?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Block 61 was in charge of a noncommissioned officer
called Wilhelm, who personally supervised the executions; and it
was he who ordered what patients should be selected to be sent to
that block. I think the situation is sufficiently clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I beg your pardon. You were given no specific
details?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The order to send the incurables .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Witness, it strikes me that you are not giving
a straightforward answer of “yes” or “no,” but that you persist in
evading the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: It was said that these patients were to be sent to
Block 61. Nothing more was added but every patient sent to
Block 61 was executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: That is not first-hand observation. You found
out or you heard that those who were sent there did not come back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: That is not correct. I could see for myself, for I was
the only doctor who could enter Block 61, which was under the
command of an internee called Louis Cunish (or Remisch). I was
able to get a few of the patients out; the others died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: If such a thing was said to you, why did you
not say that you would not do it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: If I understand the question correctly, I am being
asked why, when I was told to send the most serious cases .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: When you received instructions to select
patients for Block 61 why did you not say, “I know what will
happen to those people, and therefore I will not do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Because it would have meant death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: And what would it have meant if Germans had
refused to carry out such an order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: What Germans are you talking about? German
internees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: A German doctor, if you like, or anyone else
employed in the hospital. What would have happened to him if he
had received such an order and refused to carry it out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: If an internee refused point-blank to execute such
an order, it meant death. In point of fact, we sometimes could
evade such orders. I emphasize the fact that I never sent anyone
to Block 61.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I have one more general question to ask about
conditions in the camp. For those who have never seen a camp it
is difficult to imagine what conditions were actually like. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
you could give the Tribunal a short description of how the camp
was arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I think I have already spoken at sufficient length on
the organization of the camp. I should like to ask the President
whether it will serve any useful purpose to return to this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I believe it is not necessary. [<span class='it'>To Herr Babel</span>]
If you want to put any particular cross-examination to him to
show he is not telling the truth, you can, but not to ask him for a
general description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The camp consists of an inner site surrounded
and secured by barbed wire. The barracks in which the prisoners
were housed were inside this camp. How was this inner camp
guarded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you kindly put one question at a time?
The question you just put involves three or four different matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: How was the part of the camp in which the
living quarters are situated, separated from the rest? What security
measures were taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The camp was a unified whole, cut off from the rest
of the world by an electrified barbed wire network.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Where were the guards?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The guards of the camp were in towers situated all
around the camp; they were stationed at the gate and they patrolled
inside the camp itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Inside the camp? Inside the barbed wire
enclosure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: Obviously, inside the camp and inside the barracks,
of course. They had the right to go everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I have been informed that each separate barrack
was under the supervision of only one man, a German SS man or
a member of some other organization, that there were no other
guards, that these guards were not intended to act as guards but
only to keep order, and that the so-called Kapos, who were chosen
from the ranks of the prisoners, had the same authority as the
guards and performed the duties of the guards. It may have been
different in Buchenwald. My information comes from Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I have already answered all these questions in my
statement by saying that the camps were run by the SS in a
manner which is common knowledge and that in addition the SS
employed the internees as intermediaries in many instances. This
was the case in Buchenwald and, I suppose, in all the other
concentration camps.
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The answer to the question has again been
highly evasive. I shall not, however, pursue the matter any further,
as in any case I shall not receive a definite answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I should like to put one further question: You stated in
connection with the facts you described that a professor, whose
name I could not understand through the earphones and who was,
I believe, a professor of your own, was housed in Block 58. You
stated in connection with the question of degradation that at first
300 people, I think, were housed there and later on 1,200. Is that
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: There were 1,200 men in Block 58 when I found
Dr. Kindberg there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Yes. And if I understood you correctly, you
said that in this block there were not only Frenchmen, but also
Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Jews and that a state of degradation
was caused not only through the herding together of 1,200 people
but also through the intermingling of so many different nationalities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I want to make it clear that the intermingling of
elements speaking a different language, men who are unable to
understand each other, is not a crime; but it was a pre-disposing
factor which furthered all the other measures employed to bring
about a state of human degradation among the prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: So you consider that the intermingling of
Frenchmen, Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Jews is a degradation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: I do not see the point of this question. The fact of
intermingling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: There is no need for you to see the point; I
know why I am asking the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The fact of putting men who speak different languages
together is not degrading. I did not either think or say such a
thing; but the herding together of elements which differ from each
other in every respect and especially in that of language, in itself
made living conditions more difficult, and paved the way for the
application of other measures which I have already described at
length and whose final aim was the degradation of the human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I cannot understand why the necessity of
associating with people whose language one does not understand
should be degrading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, he has given his answer, that he
considers it tended to degradation. It does not matter whether you
understand it or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Mr. President, the transmission through the
earphones is sometimes so imperfect that I, at least, often cannot
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
hear exactly what the witness says and for that reason I have
unfortunately been compelled to have an answer repeated from
time to time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I should not like the Tribunal to mistake this
interpolation for an interruption of the cross-examination; but I
think I must say that some confusion was undoubtedly created in
the mind of the Defense Counsel just now in consequence of an
interpreter’s error which has been brought to my notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked my witness an insidious question, namely, whether the
French deportees were criminals for the most part, and the question
was interpreted as follows: whether the French deportees were
criminals. The witness answered the question as translated into
French and not as asked in German. I therefore request that the
question be put once more by the Defense Counsel and correctly
translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you understand what Mr. Dubost said,
Dr. Babel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I think I understand the substance. I think I
understand that there was a mistake in the translation. I am not
in a position to judge; I cannot follow both the French and German
text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think the best course is to continue your
cross-examination, if you have any more questions to ask, and
Mr. Dubost can clear up the difficulty in re-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Mr. President, the Defense Counsel for Kaltenbrunner
has already explained today that it is very difficult for
the Defense to cross-examine a witness without being informed at
least one day before as to the subjects on which the witness is to
be heard. The testimony given by today’s witnesses was so
voluminous that it is impossible for me to follow it without previous
preparation and to prepare and conduct from brief notes the
extensive cross-examinations which are necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To my knowledge, the President has already informed Defense
Counsel for the organizations that we shall have an opportunity
of re-examining the witnesses later or of calling them on our own
behalf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have already said what I have to say on
behalf of the Tribunal on that point, but as Counsel for the Defense
must have anticipated that witnesses would be called as to the
conditions in the concentration camps, I should have thought they
could have prepared their cross-examination during the 40 or more
days during which the Trial has taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Mr. President, I do not think that this is the
proper time for me to argue the matter with the Tribunal, but I
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
may perhaps be given the opportunity of doing so later in a closed
session. I consider this necessary in the interests of the rapid and
unhampered progress of the Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no desire whatsoever to delay the proceedings. I have
the greatest interest in expediting them as far as possible, but I
am anxious not to do so at the cost of prejudicing the defense of
the organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, I have already pointed out to you
that you must have anticipated that the witnesses might be called
to state the conditions in concentration camps. You must therefore
have had full opportunity during the days the Trial has taken
place for making up your mind on what points you would cross-examine,
and I see no reason to discuss the matter with you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Thank you for this information. But naturally
I cannot know in advance exactly what the witness is going to say,
and I cannot cross-examine him until I have heard him. I know,
of course, that a witness is going to make a statement about concentration
camps but I cannot know in advance which particular points
he will discuss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I would ask the Tribunal to note that in
questioning the French witness the Defense used certain words the
literal translation of which is “for the most part.” This applied to
the character of the French deportees. The question was, “Were
they criminals for the most part?” The witness understood it to
be as I did: “Did you say that they were criminals?” and not “that
the convoys were for the most part composed of criminals.” His
reply was the natural one. The Tribunal will allow me to ask the
witness to give details. What was the proportion of common-law
criminals and patriots respectively among the deportees? Was he
himself a common-law criminal or a patriot? Were the generals
and other personalities whose names he has given us common-law
criminals or patriots, speaking generally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DUPONT: The proportion of French common-law criminals was
very small. The common-law criminals came from Fort Barraut in
a convoy. I cannot give the exact figures, but there were only a
few hundred out of all the internees. In other incoming convoys
the proportion of common-law criminals included was only 2 or 3
per thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, are you proposing or asking to
call other witnesses upon concentration camps? Because, as I have
already pointed out to you, the evidence, with the exception of
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
Dr. Babel’s recent cross-examination, has practically not been cross-examined;
and it is supported by other film evidence. We are
instructed by Article 18 of the Charter to conduct the Trial in as
expeditious a way as possible; and I will point out to you, as
ordered under 24e of the Charter, you have the opportunity of
calling rebutting evidence, if it were necessary and, therefore, if
the evidence which has been so fully gone into as to the condition
in concentration camps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The witness whom I propose to ask the Tribunal
to hear will elucidate a point which has been pending for several
weeks. The Tribunal will remember that when my American
colleagues were presenting their evidence, the question of
ascertaining whether Kaltenbrunner had been in Mauthausen arose.
In evidence of this, I am going to call M. Boix, who will prove to
the Tribunal that Kaltenbrunner had been in Mauthausen. He has
photographs of that visit and the Tribunal will see them, as the
witness brought them with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Boix, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FRANÇOIS BOIX (Witness): François Boix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you French?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I am a Spanish refugee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me. I swear
to speak without hate or fear, to say the truth, all the truth, only
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raise your right hand and say, “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Dubost, will you spell the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: B-O-I-X. [<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] You were
born on 14 August 1920 in Barcelona?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are a news photographer, and you were
interned in the camp of Mauthausen, since .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Since 27 January 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You handed over to the commission of inquiry a
certain number of photographs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They are going to be projected on the screen and
you will state under oath under what circumstances and where
these pictures were taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How did you obtain these pictures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Owing to my professional knowledge, I was sent to Mauthausen
to work in the identification branch of the camp. There was
a photographic branch, and pictures of everything happening in the
camp could be taken and sent to the High Command in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Pictures were then projected on the screen.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This is the general view of the quarry. Is this
where the internees worked?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Most of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Where is the stairway?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: In the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many steps were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: 160 steps at first; later on there were 186.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We can proceed to the next picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: This was taken in the quarry during a visit from Reichsführer
Himmler, Kaltenbrunner, the Governor of Linz, and some
other leaders whose names I do not know. What you see below is
the dead body of a man who had fallen from the top of the quarry
(70 meters), as happened every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We can proceed to the next picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: This was taken in April 1941. My Spanish comrades who
had sought refuge in France are pulling a wagon loaded with earth.
That was the work we had to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: By whom was this picture taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: At that time by Paul Ricken, a professor from Essen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We may proceed to the next one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: This staged the scene of an Austrian who had escaped.
He was a carpenter in the garage and he managed to make a box,
a box in which he could hide and so get out of the camp. But after
a while he was recaptured. They put him on the wheelbarrow in
which corpses were carried to the crematorium. There were some
placards saying in German, “Alle Vögel sind schon da,” meaning
“All the birds are back again.” He was sentenced and then paraded
in front of 10,000 deportees to the music of a gypsy band playing
a song “J’attendrai.” When he was hanged, his body swung to and
fro in the wind while they played the very well known song, “Bill
Black Polka.”
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The next one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: This is the scene; in this picture we see on the right and
left all the deportees in a row; on the left are the Spaniards, they
are smaller. The man in the front with the beret is a criminal from
Berlin by the name of Schultz, who was employed on these occasions.
In the background you can see the man who is about to be
hanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Next one. Who took these pictures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: By the SS Oberscharführer Fritz Kornatz. He was killed
by American troops in Holland in 1944. This man, a Russian prisoner
of war, got a bullet in the head. They hanged him to make us
think he was a suicide and had tried to hurl himself against the
barbed wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other picture shows some Dutch Jews. That was taken at
Barracks C, the so-called quarantine barracks. The Jews were
driven to hurl themselves against the barbed wire on the very day
of their arrival because they realized that there was no hope to
escape for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: By whom were these pictures taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: At this time by the SS Oberscharführer Paul Ricken, a
professor from Essen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Next one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: These are 2 Dutch Jews. You can see the red star they
wore. That was an alleged attempt to escape (Fluchtversuch).</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was it in reality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The SS sent them to pick up stones near the barbed
wires, and the SS guards at the second barbed wire fence fired on
them, because they received a reward for every man they shot down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other picture shows a Jew in 1941 during the construction
of the so-called Russian camp, which later became the sanitary
camp, hanged with the cord which he used to keep up his trousers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was it suicide?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: It was alleged to be. It was a man who no longer had
any hope of escape. He was driven to desperation by forced labor
and torture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What is this picture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: A Jew whose nationality I do not know. He was put in
a barrel of water until he could not stand it any longer. He was
beaten to the point of death and then given 10 minutes in which to
hang himself. He used his own belt to do it, for he knew what
would happen to him otherwise.
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who took that picture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The SS Oberscharführer Paul Ricken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: And what is this picture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Here you see the Viennese police visiting the quarry.
This was in June or July 1941. The two deportees whom you see
here are two of my Spanish comrades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What are they doing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: They are showing the police how they had to raise the
stones, because there were no other appliances for doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you know any of the policemen who came?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No, because they came only once. We had just time to
have a look at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The date of this picture is September 1943, on the birthday of
Obersturmbannführer Franz Ziereis. He is surrounded by the whole
staff of Mauthausen Camp. I can give you the names of all the
people in the picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Pass the next photo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: This is a picture taken on the same day as Obersturmbannführer
Franz Ziereis’s birthday. The other man was his adjutant.
I forgot his name. It must be remembered that this adjutant
was a member of the Wehrmacht and put on an SS uniform as soon
as he came to the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who is that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: That is the same visit to Mauthausen by police officials
in June or July 1941. This is the kitchen door. The prisoners standing
there had been sent to the disciplinary company. They used
that little appliance on their backs for carrying stones up to a weight
of 80 kilos, until they were exhausted. Very few men ever came
back from the disciplinary company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This picture shows Himmler’s visit to the Führerheim at Camp
Mauthausen in April 1941. It shows Himmler with the Governor of
Linz in the background and Obersturmbannführer Ziereis, the commanding
officer of Camp Mauthausen, on his left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This picture was taken in the quarry. In the rear, to the left,
you see a group of deportees at work. In the foreground are Franz
Ziereis, Himmler, and Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner. He is
wearing the gold Party emblem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This picture was taken in the quarry? By whom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: By the SS Oberscharführer Paul Ricken. This was
between April and May 1941. This gentleman frequently visited the
camp at that period to see how similar camps could be organized
throughout Germany and in the occupied countries.
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have finished. You give us your assurance that
it is really Kaltenbrunner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I give you my assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: And that this picture was taken in the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I give you my assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you taken to Mauthausen as a prisoner of
war or as a political prisoner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: As a prisoner of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You had fought as a volunteer in the French
Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Either in infantry battalions or in the Foreign Legion, or
in the pioneer regiments attached to the Army to which I belonged.
I was in the Vosges with the 5th Army. We were taken prisoners.
We retreated as far as Belfort where I was taken prisoner in the
night of 20-21 June 1940. I was put with some fellow Spaniards and
transferred to Mulhouse. Knowing us to be former Spanish Republicans
and anti-fascists, they put us in among the Jews as members
of a lower order of humanity (Untermensch). We were prisoners
of war for 6 months and then we learned that the Minister
for Foreign Affairs had had an interview with Hitler to discuss the
question of foreigners and other matters. We knew that our status
had been among the questions raised. We heard that the Germans
had asked what was to be done with Spanish prisoners of war who
had served in the French Army, those of them who were Republicans
and ex-members of the Republican Army. The answer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Never mind that. So although you were a prisoner
of war you were sent to a camp not under Army control?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Exactly. We were prisoners of war. We were told that
we were being transferred to a subordinate Kommando, like all the
other Frenchmen. Then we were transferred to Mauthausen where,
for the first time, we saw that there were no Wehrmacht soldiers
and we realized that we were in an extermination camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many of you arrived there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: At the end we were 1,500; altogether 8,000 Spaniards at
the time of our arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many of you were liberated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Approximately 1,600.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no more questions to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you want to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I shall have some questions. If the President
will permit me I shall present them in tomorrow’s session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire now to say that
the Defendant Kaltenbrunner will be absent from this morning’s
session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In my capacity as representative of the French
Prosecution, I wish to ask the Tribunal to consider this request.
The witnesses that were interrogated yesterday are to be cross-examined
by the Defense. The conditions under which they are
here are rather precarious, for it takes 30 hours to return to Paris.
We would like to know whether we are to keep them here; and, if
the Defense really intends to cross-examine them, we should like to
proceed with that as quickly as possible in order to ensure their
return to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In view of what you said yesterday, M.
Dubost, I said on behalf of the Tribunal that Herr Babel might have
the opportunity of cross-examining one of your witnesses within the
next two days. Is Herr Babel ready to cross-examine that witness
now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: No, Mr. President, I have not yet received a copy
of his interrogation and consequently have not been able to prepare
my cross-examination. The time from yesterday to today is, naturally,
also too short. Therefore, I cannot yet make a definite statement
whether or not I shall want to cross-examine the witness. If
I were given an opportunity during the course of the day to get the
Record.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing</span>] Well, that witness must stay
until tomorrow afternoon, M. Dubost, but the other witnesses can go.
M. Dubost, will you see, if you can, that a copy of the shorthand
notes is furnished to Herr Babel as soon as possible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Boix, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall have it done, My Lord. We continue. The Tribunal will
remember that yesterday afternoon we projected six photographs of
Mauthausen which were brought to us by the witness who is now
before you and on which he offered his comments. This witness
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
specifically stated under what conditions the photograph representing
Kaltenbrunner in the quarry of Mauthausen had been taken.
We offer these photographs as a French document, Exhibit Number
RF-332.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you allow me to formulate one more question to the witness?
Then I shall be through with him, at least concerning the
important part of this testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, do you recognize among the defendants anyone who
visited the camp of Mauthausen during your internment there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Speer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: When did you see him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: He came to the Gusen Camp in 1943 to arrange for some
constructions and also to the quarry at Mauthausen. I did not see
him myself as I was in the identification service of the camp and
could not leave, but during these visits Paul Ricken, head of the
identification department, took a roll of film with his Leica which
I developed. On this film I recognized Speer and some leaders of
the SS as well, who came with him. Speer wore a light-colored suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You saw that on the pictures that you developed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes. I recognized him on the photos and afterward we
had to write his name and the date because many SS always wanted
to have collections of all the photos of visits to the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recognized Speer on 36 photographs which were taken by SS
Oberscharführer Paul Ricken in 1943, during Speer’s visit to the
Gusen Camp and the quarry of Mauthausen. He always looked
extremely pleased in these pictures. There are even pictures which
show him congratulating Obersturmbannführer Franz Ziereis, then
commander of the Mauthausen Camp, with a cordial handshake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: One last question. Were there any officiating chaplains
in your camp? How did the internees who wanted religious
consolation die?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes, from what I could observe, there were several.
There was an order of German Catholics, known as “Bibelforscher,”
but officially .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: But officially did the administration of the camp
grant the internees the right to practice their religion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No, they could do nothing, they were absolutely forbidden
even to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Even to live?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Even to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were there any Catholic chaplains or any Protestant
pastors?
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: That sort of Bibelforscher were almost all Protestants.
I do not know much about this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How were monks, priests, and pastors treated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: There was no difference between them and ourselves.
They died in the same way we did. Sometimes they were sent to
the gas chamber, at times they were shot, or plunged in freezing
water; any way was good enough. The SS had a particularly harsh
method of handling these people, because they knew that they were
not able to work as normal laborers. They treated all intellectuals
of all countries in this manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They were not allowed to exercise their functions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No, not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did the men who died have a chaplain before
being executed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No, not at all. On the contrary, at times, instead of being
consoled, as you say, by anyone of their faith, they received, just
before being shot, 25 or 75 lash with a leather thong even from
an SS Obersturmbannführer personally. I noticed especially the
cases of a few officers, political commissars, and Russian prisoners
of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions to ask of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Witness, please tell us what you know about
the extermination of Soviet prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I cannot possibly tell you all I know about it; I know
so much that one month would not suffice to tell you all about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Then I would like to ask you, Witness, to tell
us concisely what you know about the extermination of Soviet
prisoners in the camp of Mauthausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The arrival of the first prisoners of war took place in
1941. The arrival of 2,000 Russian prisoners of war was announced.
With regard to Russian prisoners of war, they took the same
precautions as in the case of the Republican Spanish prisoners of
war. They put machine guns everywhere around the barracks and
expected the worst. As soon as the Russian prisoners of war entered
the camp one could see that they were in a very bad state, they
could not even understand anything. They were human scarecrows.
They were then put in barracks, 1,600 to a barracks. You must bear
in mind these barracks were 7 meters wide by 50 long. They were
divested of their clothes, of the very little they had with them;
they could keep only one pair of drawers and one shirt. One has
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
to remember that this was in November and in Mauthausen it was
more than 10 degrees (centigrade) below zero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon their arrival there were already 20 deaths, from walking
only the distance of 4 kilometers between the station and camp of
Mauthausen. At first the same system was applied to them as to us
Republican Spanish prisoners. They left us with nothing to do,
with no work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were left to themselves, but with scarcely anything to eat.
At the end of a few weeks they were already at the end of their
endurance. Then began the process of elimination. They were made
to work under the most horrible conditions, they were beaten, hit,
kicked, insulted; and out of the 7,000 Russian prisoners of war who
came from almost everywhere, only 30 survivors were left at the
end of three months. Of these 30 survivors photographs were taken
by Paul Ricken’s department as a document. I have these pictures
and I can show them if the Tribunal so wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You do have these pictures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: M. Dubost knows about that, yes. M. Dubost has them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Thank you. Can you show these pictures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: M. Dubost has them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Thank you. What do you know about the
Yugoslavs and the Poles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The first Poles came to the camp in 1939 at the moment
of the defeat of Poland. They received the same treatment as
everybody else did. At that time there were only ordinary German
bandits there. Then the work of extermination was begun. There
were tens of thousands of Poles who died under frightful conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The position of the Yugoslavs should be emphasized. The
Yugoslavs began to arrive in convoys, wearing civilian clothes; and
they were shot in a legal way, so to speak. The SS wore even
their steel helmets for these executions. They shot them two at a
time. The first transport brought 165, the second 180, and after
that they came in small groups of 15, 50, 60, 30; and even women
came then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It should be noted that once, among four women who were
shot—and that was the only time in the camp of deportees—some
of them spat in the face of the camp Führer before dying. The
Yugoslavs suffered as few people have suffered. Their position is
comparable only to that of the Russians. Until the very end they
were massacred by every means imaginable. I would like to say
more about the Russians, because they have gone through so
much .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Do I understand correctly from your testimony
that the concentration camp was really an extermination camp?
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The camp was placed in the last category, category 3;
that is, it was a camp from which no one could come out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does Counsel for Great Britain desire to
cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL H. J. PHILLIMORE (Junior Counsel for United Kingdom):
No questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel for the United States?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. THOMAS J. DODD (Executive Trial Counsel for the United
States): No questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any counsel for the defendants wish to
cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Witness, how were you marked in the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The number? What kind of brand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The prisoners were marked by variously colored
stars, red, green, yellow, and so forth. Was this so in Mauthausen
also? What did you wear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Everybody wore insignia. They were not stars; they
were triangles and letters to show the nationality. Yellow and red
stars were for the Jews, stars with six red and yellow points, two
triangles, one over the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What color did you wear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: A blue triangle with an “S” in it, that is to say “Spanish
political refugee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Were you a Kapo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No, I was an interpreter at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What were your tasks and duties there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I had to translate into Spanish all the barbaric things
the Germans wished to tell the Spanish prisoners. Afterwards my
work was with photography, developing the films which were taken
all over the camp showing the full story of what happened in the
camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What was the policy with regard to visitors?
Did visitors go only into the inner camp or to places where work
was being done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: They visited all the camps. It was impossible for them
not to know what was going on. Exception was made only when
high officials or other important persons from Poland, Austria, or
Slovakia, from all these countries, would come. Then they would
show them only the best parts. Franz Ziereis would say, “See for
yourselves.” He searched out cooks, interned bandits, fat and
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
well-fed criminals. He would select these so as to be able to say
that all internees looked like these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Were the prisoners forbidden to communicate
with each other concerning conditions in the camp? Communication
with the outside was, of course, scarcely possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: It was so completely forbidden that, if anyone was caught
at it, it meant not only his death but for all those of his nationality
terrible reprisals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What observations can you make regarding the
Kapos? How did they behave toward your fellow internees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: At times they were really worthy of being SS themselves.
To be a Kapo, one had to be Aryan, pure Aryan. That means that
they had a martial bearing and, like the SS, full rights over us;
they had the right to treat us like beasts. The SS gave them
<span class='it'>carte blanche</span> to do with us what they wished. That is why, at the
liberation, the prisoners and deportees executed all the Kapos on
whom they could lay their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly before the liberation the Kapos asked to enlist
voluntarily in the SS and they left with the SS because they knew
what was awaiting them. In spite of that we looked for them
everywhere and executed them on the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You said “they had to treat you like wild
beasts.” From what facts do you draw the conclusion that they
were obliged to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: One would have to be blind in order not to see. One
could see the way they behaved. It was better to die like a man
than to live like a beast; but they preferred to live like beasts, like
savages, like criminals. They were known as such. I lived there
four and a half years and I know very well what they did. There
were many among us who could have become Kapos for their work,
because they were specialists in some field or another in the camp.
But they preferred to be beaten and massacred, if necessary, rather
than become a Kapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other member of the defendants’
counsel wish to ask questions of the witness? M. Dubost, do you
wish to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: My Lord, the witness informed us that he
had at his disposal the photographic documents of 30 Soviet
prisoners of war, the sole survivors of several thousand internees
in this camp. I would like to ask your permission, Mr. President,
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
to present this photographic document to the witness so that he
can confirm before the Tribunal that it is really this group of
Soviet prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly you may show the photograph to
the witness if it is available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes. Witness, can you show this picture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness presented the picture to the Tribunal.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is this the photograph?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes, I can assure you that these 30 survivors were still
living in 1942. Since then, in view of the conditions of the camp, it
is very difficult to know whether some of them are still alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you please give the date when this
photograph was taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: It was at the end of the winter of 1941-42. At that time,
it was still 10 degrees (centigrade) below zero. You can see from
the picture the appearance of the prisoners because of the cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has this book been put in evidence yet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This book has been submitted as evidence, Your
Honor, as official evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have the defendants got copies of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It was submitted as Exhibit Number RF-331
(Document F-321). The Defense have also received a copy of this
book in German, but the pictures are not in the German version,
Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well then, let this photograph be marked. It
had better be marked with a French exhibit number, I think. What
will it be?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We shall give it Exhibit Number RF-333.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let it be marked in that way, and then hand
it to Herr Babel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Thank you, Sir. I have no more questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you hand the photo to Dr. Babel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The photo was handed to Herr Babel.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it should be handed about to the other defendants’
counsel in case they wish to ask any question about it. M. Dubost,
I think that an approved copy of this book, including the photographs,
has been deposited in the defendants’ Information Center.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The whole book, except for the pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why not the pictures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: At that moment we did not have them to submit.
In our exposé we have not mentioned the photographs.
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The German counsel ought to have the same
documents as are submitted to the Tribunal. The photographs have
been submitted to the Tribunal; therefore they should have been
deposited in the Information Center.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, the French text, including the
pictures, was deposited in the Defense Information Center; and, in
addition, a certain number of texts in German, to which the
pictures were not added because we had that translation prepared
for the use of the Defense. But there are French copies of the book
that you have before you which include the pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We have here four copies of the picture which was
shown yesterday afternoon, which we shall place before you. It
shows Kaltenbrunner and Himmler in the quarry of Mauthausen,
in accordance with the testimony given by Boix. One of these
pictures will also be delivered to the Defense, that is, to the lawyer
of the Defendant Kaltenbrunner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now the photograph has been handed
around to the defendants’ counsel. Do any members of the defendants’
counsel wish to ask any questions of the witness about this
photograph? No question? The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: I would like to say something more. I would like to note
that there were cases when Soviet officers were massacred. It is
worth noting because it concerns prisoners of war. I would like the
Tribunal to listen to me carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is it you wish to say about the
massacre of the Soviet prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: In 1943 there was a transport of officers. On the very
day of their arrival in the camp they began to be massacred by
every means. But it seems that from the higher quarters orders
had come concerning these officers saying that something
extraordinary had to be done. So they put them in the best block
in the camp. They gave them new prisoner’s clothing. They gave
them even cigarettes; they gave them beds with sheets; they were
given everything they wanted to eat. A medical officer, Sturmbannführer
Bresbach, examined them with a stethoscope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went down into the quarry, but they carried only small
stones, and in fours. At that time Oberscharführer Paul Ricken,
chief of the service, was there with his Leica taking pictures
without stopping. He took about 48 pictures. These I developed
and five copies of each, 13 by 18, with the negatives, were sent to
Berlin. It is too bad I did not steal the negatives, as I did the
others.
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>When that was done, the Russians were made to give up their
clothing and everything else and were sent to the gas chamber.
The comedy was ended. Everybody could see on the pictures that
the Russian prisoners of war, the officers, and especially the
political commissars, were treated well, worked hardly at all, and
were in good condition. That is one thing that should be noted
because I think it is necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And another thing, there was a barrack called Barrack
Number 20. That barrack was inside the camp; and in spite of the
electrified barbed wire around the camp, there was an additional
wall with electrified barbed wire around it. In that barrack there
were prisoners of war, Russian officers and commissars, some Slavs,
a few Frenchmen, and, they said, even a few Englishmen. No one
could enter that barrack except the two Führer who were in the
camp prison, the commanding officers of the inner and outer camps.
These internees were dressed just as we were, like convicts, but
without number or identification of their nationality. One could not
tell their nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The service “Erkennungsdienst” must have taken their pictures.
A tag with a number was placed on their chest. This number began
with 3,000 and something. There were numbers looking like
Number 11 (two blue darts), and the numbers started at 3,000 and
went up to 7,000. SS Unterscharführer Hermann Schinlauer was
the photographer then in charge. He was from the Berlin region,
somewhere outside of Berlin, I do not remember the name. He had
orders to develop the films and to do all work personally; but like
all the SS of the interior services of the camp, they were men who
knew nothing. They always needed prisoners to get their work
done. That is why he needed me to develop these films. I made
the enlargements, 5 by 7. These were sent to Obersturmführer
Karl Schulz, of Cologne, the Chief of the Politische Abteilung. He
told me not to tell anything to anybody about these pictures and
about the fact that we developed these films; if we did we would be
liquidated at once. Without any fear of the consequences I told all
my comrades about it, so that, if one of us should succeed in getting
out, he could tell the world about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we have heard enough of this detail
that you are giving us. But come back for a moment to the case
you were speaking of. I wish you would repeat the case of the
Russian prisoners of war in 1943. You said that the officers were
taken to the quarry to carry the heaviest stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No, just very small stones, weighing not even 20 kilos,
and they carried them in fours to show on the pictures that the
Russian officers did not do heavy work but on the contrary, light
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
work. That was only for the pictures, whereas in reality it was
entirely different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I thought you said they carried big, heavy
stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Were the photographs taken while they were
in their uniforms carrying these light stones?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes, Sir; they had to put on clean uniforms, neatly
arranged, to show that the Russian prisoners were well and
properly treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Is there any other particular
incident you want to refer to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Yes, about Block 20. Thanks to my knowledge of photography
I was able to see it; I had to be there to handle the lights
while my chief took photographs. In this way I could follow, detail
by detail, everything that took place in this barrack. It was an
inner camp. This barrack, like all the others, was 7 meters wide
and 50 meters long. There were 1,800 internees there, with a food
ration less than one-quarter of what we would get for food. They
had neither spoons nor plates. Large kettles of spoiled food were
emptied on the snow and left there until it began to freeze; then
the Russians were ordered to get at it. The Russians were so
hungry, they would fight for this food. The SS used these fights
as a pretext to beat some of them with bludgeons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean that the Russians were put
directly into Block 20?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The Russians did not come to the camp directly. Those
who were not sent to the gas chamber right away were placed
in Block 20. Nobody of the inner camp, not even the Blockführer,
was allowed to enter this barrack. Small convoys of 50 or 60 came
several times a week and always one heard the noise of a fight
going on inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1945, when the Russians learned that the Soviet
Armies were approaching Yugoslavia, they took one last chance.
They seized fire extinguishers and killed soldiers posted under the
watch tower. They seized machine guns and everything possible as
weapons. They took blankets with them and everything they could
find. They were 700, but only 62 succeeded in passing into Yugoslavia
with the partisans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day, Franz Ziereis, camp commander, issued an order by
radio to all civilians to co-operate, to “liquidate” the Russian
criminals who had escaped from the concentration camp. He stated
that everyone who could produce evidence that he had killed one
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
of these men would receive an extraordinary sum of marks. This
was why all the Nazi followers in Mauthausen went to work and
succeeded in killing more than 600 escaped prisoners. It was not
hard because some of the Russians could not drag themselves for
more than 10 meters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the liberation one of the surviving Russians came to
Mauthausen to see how everything was then. He told us all the
details of his painful march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think the Tribunal wants to hear
more details which you did not see yourself. Does any member of
the Defense Counsel wish to ask any question of the witness upon
the points which he has dealt with himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: One question only. In the course of your
testimony you gave certain figures, namely 165, then 180, and just
now 700. Were you in a position to count them yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Nearly always the convoys came into the camp in
columns of five. It was easy to count them. These transports were
always sent from the Wehrmacht, from the Wehrmacht prisons
somewhere in Germany. They were sent from all prisons in
Germany, from the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the SD, or the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just answer the question and do not make
a speech. You have said they were brought in in columns of five
and it was easy to count them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: Very easy to count them, particularly for those who
wanted to be able to tell the story some day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Did you have so much time that you were able
to observe all these things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BOIX: The transports always came in the evening after the
deportees had returned to the camp. At this time we always had
two or three hours when we could wander about in the camp
waiting for the bell that was the signal for us to go to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness may now retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If the Tribunal permits, we shall now hear
Mr. Cappelen, who is a Norwegian witness. The testimony of
Mr. Cappelen will be limited to the conditions that were imposed
on Norwegian internees in Norwegian camps and prisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Hans Cappelen, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I understand that you speak English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. HANS CAPPELEN (Witness): Yes, I speak English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you take the English form of oath?
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Yes, I prefer to speak in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: My name is Hans Cappelen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swear that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in English.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To the witness.</span>] Raise your right hand and
say “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: M. Cappelen, you were born 18 December 1903?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In what town?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: I was born in Kvitseid, province of Telemark,
Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What is your profession?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: I was a lawyer, but now I am a business man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you tell what you know of the atrocities of
the Gestapo in Norway?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: My Lord, I was arrested on 29 November 1941 and
taken to the Gestapo prison in Oslo, Moellergata 19. After 10 days
I was interrogated by two Norwegian NS, or Nazi police agents.
They started in at once to beat me with bludgeons. How long this
interrogation lasted I cannot remember, but it led to nothing. So
after some days I was brought to 32 Victoria Terrace. That was
the headquarters of the Gestapo in Norway. It was about 8 o’clock
at night. I was brought into a fairly big room and they asked me
to undress. I had to undress until I was absolutely naked. I was a
little bit swollen after the first treatment I had by the Norwegian
police agents, but it was not too bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were present about six or eight Gestapo agents and their
leader was Femer; Kriminalrat was his title. He was very angry
and they started to bombard me with questions which I could not
answer. So Femer ran at me and tore all the hair off my head,
hair and blood were all over the floor around me. And so, all of a
sudden, they all started to run at me and beat me with rubber
bludgeons and iron cable-ends. That hurt me very badly and I
fainted. But I was brought back to life again by their pouring ice
water over me. I vomited, naturally, because I was feeling very
sick. But that only made them angry; and they said, “Clean up,
you dirty dog!” And I had to make an attempt to clean up with my
bare hands.
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way they carried on for a long, long time, but the interrogation
led to nothing because they bombarded me with questions
and asked me of persons whom I did not know or scarcely knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suppose it must have been in the morning I was brought back
again to the prison. I was placed in my cell and felt very sick and
weak. All during the day I asked the guard if I could not have a
doctor; that was the 19th. After some days—I suppose it must have
been the day before Christmas Eve 1941—I was again, in the night,
brought to the Victoria Terrace. The same happened as last time,
only this time it was very easy for me to undress because I had
only a coat on me. I was swollen up from the last beating. Just like
the last time, six, seven, or eight Gestapo agents were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: German Gestapo, do you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Yes, German Gestapo, all of them. And then there
was Femer present at that time, too. He had a rank in the SS
and was criminal commissar. Then they started to beat me again,
but it was useless to beat a man like me who was so swollen up
and looking so bad. Then they started in another way, they started
to screw and break my arms and legs. And my right arm was
dislocated. I felt that awful pain, and fainted again. Then the same
happened as last time; they poured water on me and I came back
again to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now all the Germans there were absolutely mad. They roared
like animals and bombarded me with questions again, but I was so
tired I could not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they placed a sort of home-made—it looked to me like
a sort of home-made—wooden thing, with a screw arrangement,
on my left leg; and they started to screw so that all the flesh
loosened from the bones. I felt an awful pain and fainted away
again. But I came back to consciousness again; and I have still big
marks here on my leg from the screw arrangement, now, four years
afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that led to nothing and then they placed something on my
neck—I still have marks here [<span class='it'>indicating</span>]—and loosened the flesh
here. But then I had a collapse and all of a sudden I felt that I was
sort of paralyzed in the right side. It has otherwise been proved
that I had a cerebral hemorrhage. And I got that double vision;
I saw two of each Gestapo agent, and all was going round and
round for me. That double vision I have had 4 years, and when
I am tired it comes back again. But I am better now, so I can move
again on the right side; but the right side is a little bit affected
from that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, I cannot remember much more from that night, but the
other prisoners who had to clean up the corridors in the prison had
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
seen them bringing me back again in the morning. That must have
been about 6 o’clock in the morning. They thought I was dead
because I had no irons on my hands. If it had been for 1 day or
2 days, I can’t tell, but one day I moved again and was a little bit
clear; and then the guard at once was in my cell where I was
lying on a cot in my own vomiting and blood, and afterwards
there came a doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had, I suppose, quite a high rank; which rank I can’t exactly
say. He told me that I most probably would die, especially if I
wasn’t—I asked him, “Couldn’t you bring me to a hospital,
because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He said, “No. Fools are not to be brought to any
hospital, before you do just what we say you shall do. Like all
Norwegians, you are a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, they put my arm into joint again. That was very bad, but
two soldiers held me and they drew it in, and I fainted away again.
So the time passed and I rested a bit. I couldn’t walk, because it
all seemed to be going around for me. So I was lying on the cot.
And so one day—it must have been in the end of February or in
the middle of February 1942—they came again. It must have been
about ten o’clock in the night, because the light in my cell had
been out for quite a long time. They asked me to stand up, and I
made an attempt, and fell down again because of the paralysis.
Then they kicked me; but I said, “Is not it better to put me to
death, because I can’t move?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, they dragged me out of the cell, and I was again brought
up to Victoria Terrace; that is the headquarters where they made
their interrogations. This time the interrogation was led by one
SS man called Stehr. I could not stand so, naked as I was, I was
lying on the floor. This Stehr had some assistants, four or five
Gestapo agents; and they started to tramp on me and to kick me.
So all of a sudden they brought me to my feet again and brought
me to a table where Stehr was sitting. He took my left hand like
this [<span class='it'>indicating</span>] and put some pins under my nails and started
to break them up. Well, it hurt me badly; and all things began
going around and around for me—the double vision—but the pain
was so intense that I drew my hand back. I should not have done
that, because that made them absolutely furious. I fainted away,
collapsed, and I do not know for how long a time; but I came back
to life again by the smelling of burned flesh or burned meat. And
then one of the Gestapo agents was standing with a little sort of
lamp burning me under my feet. It did not hurt me too much,
because I was so feeble that I did not care; and I was so paralyzed
my tongue could not work, so I could not speak, only groaned a
bit, crying, naturally, always.
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, I don’t remember much more of that time, but this was to
me one of the worst things I went through with respect to interrogations.
I was brought back again to the prison and time passed
and I attempted to eat a little bit. I spewed most of it up again,
I threw it up again, most of it. But little by little I recovered. I
was still paralyzed in the side, so I couldn’t stand up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was also taken into interrogations again, and then I was
confronted with other Norwegians, people I knew and people I did
not know; and the most of them were badly treated. They were
swollen up, and I remember especially two of my friends, two very
good persons. I had been confronted with them, and they were
looking very bad from torture, and when I came back again after
my imprisonment I learned that they both were dead; they had
died from the treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another incident which I aim to tell—I hope My Lord will
permit me to do it—concerned a person called Sverre Emil
Halvorsen. He was one day—that must have been in the autumn
or in August or October 1943—a little bit swollen up and very
unhappy; and he said they had treated him so bad, but he and
some of his friends had been in some sort of a court where they
had been told that they were to be shot the next day. They placed
a sort of sentence upon them, just to set an example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, Halvorsen had, naturally, a headache and felt very ill, and
I asked the guard to bring—the head guard, that was a person
named Herr Götz. He came and asked what the devil I wanted. I
said, “My comrade is very ill, could not he have some aspirins?”
“Oh no,” he said, “it is a waste to give him aspirin, because he is
to be shot in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning he was brought out of the cell, and after the war
they found him up at Trondheim together with other Norwegians
in a grave there with a bullet through his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, the Moellergate 19, in Oslo, the prison where I was for
about 25 months, was a house of horror. I heard every night—nearly
every night—people screaming and groaning. One day, it
must have been in December 1943, about the 8th of December, they
came into my cell and told me to dress. It was in the night. I put
on my ragged clothes, what I had. Now I had recovered, practically.
I was naturally lame on the one side, could not walk so well, but
I could walk; and I went down in the corridor and there they
placed me as usual against the wall, and I waited that they would
bring me away and shoot me. But they did not shoot me; they
brought me to Germany together with lots of other Norwegians. I
learned afterwards about some few of my friends—and by friends,
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
I mean Norwegians. We were so-called “Nacht und Nebel” prisoners,
“Night and Mist” prisoners. We were brought to a camp
called Natzweiler, in Alsace. It was a very bad camp, I must say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had to work to take stones out of the mountains. But I shall
not bore you about my tales from Natzweiler, My Lord, I will
only say that people of all other nations—French, Russians, Dutch,
and Belgians—were there and we are about five hundred
Norwegians who have been there. Between 60 and 70 percent died
there or in other camps of concentration. Also, two Danes were
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we saw many cruel things there, so cruel that they need—they
are well known. The camp had to be evacuated in September
1944. We were then brought to Dachau near Munich, but we did
not stay long there; at least, I didn’t stay long there. I was sent to
a Kommando called Aurich in East Friesland, where we were
about—that was an under-Kommando of Neuengamme, near Hamburg.
We were about fifteen hundred prisoners. We had to dig
tank traps. Well, we had to walk every day about 3 or 4 hours,
and go by train for 1 hour to the Panzer Gräben where we worked.
The work was so strong and so hard and the way they treated us
so bad, that most of them died there. I suppose about half of the
prisoners died of dysentery or of ill-treatment in the five or six
weeks we were there. It was too much even for the SS, who had
to take care of the camp, so they gave it up, I suppose; and I was
sent from Neuengamme, near Hamburg, to a camp called Gross-Rosen,
in Silesia; it is near Breslau. That was a very bad camp,
too. We were about 40 Norwegians there; and of those 40 Norwegians
we were about 10 left after 4 to 5 weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You will be some little time longer, so I
think we better adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: M. Cappelen, will you continue to speak to us of
your passage through those camps, particularly of what you know
of the camp of Natzweiler and the role at Natzweiler of Dr. Hirt,
Hirch, or Hirtz of the German medical faculty of Strasbourg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Well, in Natzweiler, yes, there were also carried
on experiments. Just beside the camp there was a farm they called
Struthof. That was practically a part of the camp; and some of the
prisoners had to work there to clean up the rooms; and—well not
so often, but sometimes—they were taken out. For instance, one
day, I remember, all the Gypsies were taken out, and then they
were brought down to Struthof. They were very afraid of being
brought down there.
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, one friend of mine, a Norwegian called Hvidding, who had
a job in the hospital—so-called hospital—in the camp, told me the
day after the Gypsies were taken and brought to Struthof, “I tell
you something. They have, so far as I understand, tried some sort
of gas on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come along with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, through the window of the hospital, I could see four
of the Gypsies lying in beds. They did not look well, and it was
not easy to look through the glass, but they had some mucus, I
suppose, around their mouths. And he told me that they had—Hvidding
told me—that the Gypsies could not tell much because
they were so ill, but so far as he understood, it was gas which they
had used upon them. There had been 12 of them, and 4 were living;
the other 8, so far as he understood, died down there at Struthof.
Then he told further on, “You see that man who sometimes walks
through the camp together with some others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have seen him,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is Professor Hirtz from the German University in Strasbourg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am quite sure Hvidding said that this man is Hirt or Hirtz.
He is coming here now nearly daily with a so-called commission
to see those who are coming back again from Struthof, to see the
result. That is all I know about that so far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many Norwegians died at Gross-Rosen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: In Gross-Rosen, it is not possible for me to say
here exactly; but I know about 40 persons who had been there,
and I also know about ten who came back again. Well, Gross-Rosen
was a bad camp. But nearly the worst of it all was the evacuation
of Gross-Rosen. I suppose it must have been in the middle of
February of that year. The Russians came nearer and nearer to
Breslau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean 1945?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Yes, 1945 I mean. One day we were placed upon a
so-called “Appellplatz” (roll call ground). We were very feeble, all
of us. We had hard work, little food, and all sorts of ill-treatment.
Well, we started to walk in parties of about 2,000 to 3,000. In the
party I was with, we were about 2,500 to 2,800. We heard so and
so many when they took up the numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we started to walk, and we had SS guards on each side.
They were very nervous and almost like mad persons. Several
were drunk. We couldn’t walk fast enough, and they smashed in
the heads of five who could not keep up. They said in German,
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
“That is what happens to those who cannot walk.” The others
would have been treated in the same way if they had not been
able to follow. We walked the best we could. We attempted to
help one another, but we were all too exhausted. After walking
for 6 to 8 hours we came to a station, a railway station. It was
very cold and we had only striped prison clothes on, and bad boots;
but we said, “Oh, we are glad that we have come to a railway
station. It is better to stand in a cow truck than to walk, in the
middle of winter.” It was very cold, 10 to 12 degrees below zero
(centigrade). It was a long train with open cars. In Norway we
call them sand cars, and we were kicked on to those cars, about 80
on each car. We had to sit together and on this car we sat for
about 5 days without food, cold, and without water. When it was
snowing we made like this [<span class='it'>indicating</span>] just to get some water into
the mouth and, after a long, long time—it seemed to me years—we
came to a place which I afterwards learned was Dora. That is in
the neighborhood of Buchenwald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we arrived there. They kicked us down from the cars,
but many were dead. The man who sat next to me was dead, but
I had no right to get away. I had to sit with a dead man for the
last day. I didn’t see the figures myself, naturally, but about one-third
of us or half of us were dead, getting stiff. And they told us
that one-third—I heard the figure afterwards in Dora—that the
dead on our train numbered 1,447.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, from Dora I don’t remember so much, because I was more
or less dead. I have always been a man of good humor and high
spirited, to help myself first and my friends; but I had nearly given
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not remember so much before, so I had a good chance, because
Bernadotte’s action came and we were rescued and brought to Neuengamme,
near Hamburg; and when we arrived, there were some of
my old friends, the student from Norway who had been deported to
Germany, other prisoners who came from Sachsenhausen and other
camps, and the few, comparatively few, Norwegian “NN” prisoners
who were living, all in very bad condition. Many of my friends
are still in the hospital in Norway. Some died after coming home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That’s what happened to me and my comrades in the three and
three-quarter years I was in prison. I am fully aware that it is
impossible for me to give details more than I have done; but I have
taken, so to say, the parts of it which show, I hope, the way they
behaved against Norwegians, and in Norway, the German SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: For what reason were you arrested?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: I was arrested the 29th of November 1941, in a
place called then Hoistly. That is a sort of sanitarium where one
goes skiing.
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What had you done? What was held against you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Well, what I had done. Like most of us Norwegians,
we regarded ourselves to be at war with Germany in one
way or another; and naturally we, most of us, were against them
by feelings; and also, as the Gestapo asked me, I remember, “What
do you think of Mr. Quisling?” I only answered, “What would you
have done if a German officer—even a major—when your country
was at war and your government had given an order of mobilization,
he came and said, ‘Better forget the Mobilization Order?’ ”
A man can’t do that with respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: On the whole, did the German population know of,
or were they unaware of, what went on in the camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: That is, naturally, very difficult for me to answer.
But in Norway, at least, even at the time when I was arrested, we
knew quite a lot about how the Germans treated their prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there is one thing I remember in Munich where I was
working. I was not working; I was in Dachau for that short period.
With some others, I was once brought to the town of Munich to go
into the ruins to seek for persons and find bombs and things like
that. I suppose that was the idea. They never told us anything, but
we knew what was on. We were about one hundred persons, prisoners.
We were looking like dead persons, all of us looking very
bad. We went through the streets and people could see us; and they
also could see what we were going to do, the sort of work which
one should think was very dangerous and which should in some
way help them; but it was no fun for them to see us. Some of them
were hollering to us, “It is your fault that we are bombed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were there any chaplains in your camp? Were
you allowed to pray?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Well, we had among the “NN” prisoners in Natzweiler
a priest from Norway. He was, I suppose, what you call in
English a Dean. He was of quite high rank. In Norwegian we call
it “Prost.” From the west coast of Norway. He was also brought to
Natzweiler as an “NN” prisoner, and some of my comrades asked
him if they could not meet sometimes so he could preach to them.
But he said, “No, I don’t dare to do it. I had a Bible. They have
taken it from me and they joked about it and said, ‘You dirty
churchman, if you show the Bible and things like that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ ” You
know, therefore, we did not do anything in that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Those who were dying among you, did they have
the consolation of their religion at the time of their death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were the dead treated with decency?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: No.
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was there any religious service conducted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does counsel for the U.S.S.R. desire to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I have no question, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has the United States?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>No response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then does any member of the defendants’ counsel wish to ask
the witness any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Witness, at your first interrogations which as a
rule took place about ten days after arrest, were you interrogated
by German or by Norwegian Gestapo men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: It was made by two Norwegians who belonged to,
as I learned afterward, the so-called State Police. That was not the
police in Norway. They were working together with the Gestapo;
in fact, it was the same. But it was by them I was interrogated
after the 10 days. But they, as I heard afterwards, usually did it
in that way, because it was easy to do it in Norwegian; and some
of the Germans could not speak Norwegian. Most of them could
not. I think it was, therefore, that they took the Norwegian; and
you can call them Gestapo, practically. They let them handle the
persons first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Then at the Victoria Terrace, which name I
believe you used to designate the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo,
were there Norwegian or German officials present during your
interrogation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: I dare say there may have been one Norwegian
as a sort of interpreter; but as I spoke the German language, I
cannot, with 100 percent surety, say if there were one or two
Norwegian policemen there. It is difficult. But as Victoria Terrace
was the headquarters of the Gestapo, naturally they had some
Norwegian Nazis to help them there. But most of them were
German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Were the persons who interrogated you in
uniform or in civilian clothes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: During my interrogation I have sometimes seen
them in uniform, too. But when they tortured me they were mostly
in civilian clothes. So far as I remember, there was only one person
in uniform during one of the torture interrogations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: You stated that you were then treated by a
physician. Did this physician come of his own free will or was he
asked to come?
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: The first time I asked for a doctor, but then I did
not get any. But at the time when I came back to consciousness,
when I was supposed perhaps to be dead, the guard possibly had
been looking at me because he was then running away; and afterwards
they came with a doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Did you know that in the German concentration
camps there was an absolute prohibition against talking about the
conditions in the camp—among the prisoners as well as to outsiders,
of course—and that any violation of the order not to talk was
subject to most severe penalties?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CAPPELEN: Well, in the camps it was like this: It was naturally
more or less understood that it was more or less forbidden to talk
about the tortures we had gone through; but naturally in the
camps, the Nacht und Nebel Camps where I was, the situation was
so bad that even torture sometimes seemed to be better than dying
slowly away like that, so almost the only thing we spoke about
was: “When shall the war end; how to help our comrades; and are
we to get some food tonight or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other defendant’s counsel wish to
ask any questions? Mr. Dubost, have you anything you wish to ask?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have nothing further to ask, Mr. President. I
thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If the Tribunal will permit, we will now hear a
witness, Roser, who will give a few details on the conditions under
which they kept French prisoners of war in reprisal camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Paul Roser, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. PAUL ROSER (Witness): Roser, Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You swear to speak without hate or fear, to
state the truth, all the truth, only the truth? Raise the right hand
and say “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness raised his right hand and repeated the oath in
French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your name is Paul Roser, R-o-s-e-r?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: R-o-s-e-r.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were born on the 8th of May 1903? You are
of French nationality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I am French.
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were born of French parents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I was born of French parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were a prisoner of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You were taken prisoner in battle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In what year?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: 14 June 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You sought to escape?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many times?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Five times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Five times. You were transferred finally to a
disciplinary camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you indicate the regime of such a camp? Will
you indicate your rank, and the treatment which French people of
your rank in those disciplinary camps had to submit to, and for
what reasons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Very well, I was an “aspirant,” a rank which, in
France, is between a first sergeant and a second lieutenant. I was
in several disciplinary camps. The first was a small camp which
the Germans called Strafkommando, in Linzburg in Hanover. It
was in 1941. There were about thirty of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While I was in that camp during the summer of 1941, we
attempted to escape. We were recaptured by our guards at the very
moment when we were leaving the camp. We were naturally
unarmed. The Germans, our guards, having recaptured one of us,
attempted to make him reveal the others who also had sought to
escape. The man remained silent. The guards hurled themselves
upon him, beating him with the butts of their pistols in the face,
with bayonets, with the butts of their rifles. At that moment, not
wishing to let our comrade be killed, several of us stepped forward
and revealed that we sought to escape. I then received a beating
with bayonets applied to my head and fell into a swoon. When I
recovered consciousness one of the Germans was kneeling on my
leg and was continuing to strike me. Another one, raising his gun,
was seeking to strike my head. I was saved on that occasion
through the intervention of my comrades, who threw themselves
between the Germans and myself. That night we were beaten for
exactly 3 hours with rifle butts, with bayonet blows, and with
pistol butts in the face. I lost consciousness three times.
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The following day we were taken to work, nevertheless. We
dug trenches for the draining of the marshes. It was a very hard
sort of work, which started at 6:30 in the morning, to be completed
at 6 o’clock at night. We had two stops, each of a half-hour. We
had nothing to eat during the day. Soup was given to us, when we
came back at night, with a piece of bread, a small sausage or
2 cubic centimeters of margarine, and that was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following our attempted escape, our guards held back from us
all the parcels which our families sent to us for a month. We could
not write nor could we receive mail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of three and a half months, in September 1941, we
were shipped to the regular Kommandos. I, personally, was quite
ill at that time and I came back to Stalag X B at Sandbostel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Why were you subjected to such a special regime,
although you were an “aspirant”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Certainly because of my attempted escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Had you agreed to work?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: No, not at all. Like all my comrades of the same rank
and like most of the noncommissioned officers and like all
“aspirants,” I had refused to work, invoking the provision of the
Geneva Convention, which Germany had signed and which
prescribed that noncommissioned officers who were prisoners
cannot be forced to perform any labor without their consent. The
German Army, into whose hands we had fallen, practically
speaking, never respected that agreement undertaken by Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Are you familiar with executions that took place
in Oflag XI B?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I was made familiar with the death of several French
or Allied prisoners, specifically at Oflag XI at Grossborn in Pomerania.
A French prisoner, Lieutenant Robin, who with some of his
comrades had prepared an escape and for that purpose had dug a
tunnel, was killed in the following manner: The Germans having
had information that the tunnel had been prepared, Hauptmann
Buchmann, who was a member of the officer staff of the camp,
watched with a few German guards for the exit of the would-be
escapees. Lieutenant Robin, who was first to emerge, was killed
with one shot while obviously he could in no manner attack anyone
or defend himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other cases of this type occurred. One of my friends, a French
Lieutenant Ledoux, who was sent to Graudenz Fortress where he
was subjected to a hard detention regime, saw his best friend,
British Lieutenant Anthony Thomson, killed by Hauptfeldwebel
Ostreich with one pistol shot in the neck, in their own cell. Lieutenant
Thomson had just sought to escape and had been recaptured
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
by the Germans on the airfield. Lieutenant Thomson belonged to
the RAF.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to state also that in the camp of Rawa-Ruska in
Galicia, where I spent 5 months, several of our comrades .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Would you tell us why you were at Rawa-Ruska?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: In the course of the winter, 1941-42, the Germans
wanted to intimidate, first, the noncommissioned officers who were
refractory in labor; second, those who had sought to escape; and
third, the men who were being employed in Kommandos (labor
gangs) and who were caught in the act of performing sabotage. The
Germans warned us that from 1 April 1942 onward all these
escapees who were recaptured would be sent to a camp, a special
camp called a Straflager, at Rawa-Ruska in Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was following another attempt to escape that I was taken to
Poland with about two thousand other Frenchmen. I was at
Limburg-an-der-Lahn, Stalag XII A, where we were regrouped
and placed in railway cars. We were stripped of our clothes, of our
shoes, of all the food which some of us had been able to keep. We
were placed in cars, in each of which the number varied from
53 to 56. The trip lasted 6 days. The cars were open generally for
a few minutes in the course of a stop in the countryside. In 6 days
we were given soup on 2 occasions only, once at Oppel, and another
time at Jaroslan, and the soup was not edible. We remained for
36 hours without anything to drink in the course of that trip, as
we had no receptacle with us and it was impossible to get a supply
of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we reached Rawa-Ruska on 1 June 1942, we found other
prisoners—most of them French, who had been there for several
weeks—extremely discouraged, with a ration scale much inferior to
anything that we had experienced until then, and no International
Red Cross or family parcel for anyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time there were about twelve to thirteen thousand in
that camp. There was for that number one single faucet which
supplied, for several hours a day, undrinkable water. This situation
lasted until the visit of two Swiss doctors, who came to the camp in
September, I think. The billets consisted of 4 barracks, where rooms
contained as many as 600 men. We were stacked in tiers along the
walls, 3 rows of them, 30 to 40 centimeters for each of us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During our stay in Rawa-Ruska there were many attempts at
escape, more than five hundred in 6 months. Several of our
comrades were killed. Some were killed at the time when a guard
noticed them. In spite of the sadness of such occurrences, no one of
us contested the rights of our guards in such cases, but several were
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
murdered. In particular, on 12 August 1942, in the Tarnopol
Kommando, a soldier, Lavesque, was found bearing evidence of
several shots and several large wounds caused by bayonets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 14th of August, in the Verciniec Kommando, 93 Frenchmen,
having succeeded in digging a tunnel, escaped. The following
morning three of them, Conan, Van den Boosch, and Poutrelle, were
caught by German soldiers, who were searching for them. Two
of them were sleeping; the third, Poutrelle, was not asleep. The
Germans, a corporal and two enlisted men, verified the identity of
the three Frenchmen. Very calmly they told them: “Now we are
obliged to kill you.” The three wretched men spoke of their
families, begged for mercy. The German corporal gave the following
reply, which we heard only too often: “Befehl ist Befehl” (“An
order is an order”); and they shot down immediately two of the
French prisoners, Van den Boosch and Conan. Poutrelle was left
like a madman and by sheer luck was not caught again. But he
was captured a few days later in the region of Kraków. He was
then brought back to Rawa-Ruska proper, where we saw him in a
condition close to madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 14th of August, once again in the Stryj Kommando, a
team of about twenty prisoners accompanied by several guards,
were on their way to work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Excuse me, you are talking about French prisoners
of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, French prisoners of war, so far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going along a wood, the German noncommissioned officer, who
for some time had been annoying two of them, Pierrel and
Ondiviella, directed them into the woods. A few moments later the
others heard shots. Pierrel and Ondiviella had just been killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 20 September 1942, at Stryj once again, a Kommando was
at work under the supervision of German soldiers and German
civilian foremen. One of the Frenchmen succeeded in escaping.
Without waiting, the German noncommissioned officers selected
two men, if my memory is correct, Saladin and Duboeuf, and shot
them on the spot. Incidents of this type occurred in other circumstances.
The list of them would be long indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you speak of the conditions under which the
refractory noncommissioned officers who were with you at camp at
Rawa-Ruska lived?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: The noncommissioned officers who refused to work
were grouped together in one section of the camp, in two of the
large stables which served as billets. They were subjected to a
regime of most severe repression; frequent roll calls for assembly;
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
lying-down and standing-up exercise which after a while leaves one
quite exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, Sergeant Corbihan, having refused Captain Fournier—a
German captain with a French name—to take a tool to work with,
the German captain made a motion and one of the German soldiers
with him ran Corbihan through with his bayonet; Corbihan by
miracle escaped death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: How many of you disappeared?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: At Rawa-Ruska, in the 5 months that I spent there, we
buried 60 of our comrades who had died from disease or had been
killed in attempted escapes. But so far, 100 of those who were with
us and sought to escape have not been found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is this all that you have witnessed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: No, I should say that our stay at the punishment camp,
Rawa-Ruska, involved one thing more awful than anything else we
prisoners saw and suffered. We were horrified by what we knew
was taking place all about us. The Germans had transformed the
area of Lvov-Rawa-Ruska into a kind of immense ghetto. Into that
area, where the Jews were already quite numerous, had been
brought the Jews from all the countries of Europe. Every day for
5 months, except for an interruption of about six weeks in August
and September 1942, we saw passing about 150 meters from our
camp, one, two, and sometimes three convoys, made up of freight
cars in which there were crowded men, women and children. One
day a voice coming from one of these cars shouted: “I am from
Paris. We are on our way to the slaughter.” Quite frequently,
comrades who went outside the camp to go to work found corpses
along the railway track. We knew in a vague sort of way at that
time that these trains stopped at Belcec, which was located about
17 kilometers from our camp; and at that point they executed these
wretched people, by what means I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night in July 1942 we heard shots of submachine guns
throughout the entire night and the moans of women and children.
The following morning bands of German soldiers were going through
the fields of rye on the very edge of our camp, their bayonets
pointed downward, seeking people hiding in the fields. Those of our
comrades who went out that day to go to their work told us that
they saw corpses everywhere in the town, in the gutters, in the
barns, in the houses. Later some of our guards, who had participated
in this operation, quite good-humoredly explained to us that 2,000
Jews had been killed that night under the pretext that two SS men
had been murdered in the region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, in 1943, during the first week of June, there occurred
a pogrom which in Lvov caused the death of 30,000 Jews. I was
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
not personally in Lvov, but several French military doctors, Major
Guiguet and Lieutenant Levin of the French Medical Corps, described
this scene to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness appears to be not finishing and
therefore I think we had better adjourn now until 2 o’clock.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: I desire to announce that the Defendant Kaltenbrunner
will be absent from this afternoon’s session on account of
illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: With the permission of the Tribunal, we shall continue
examining the witness, M. Roser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Roser, this morning you finished the description of the conditions
under which you witnessed the pogrom of Rawa-Ruska and
you wanted to give us some details on another pogrom. You told us
that a German soldier, who had taken a part in it, made a statement
to you which you wanted to relate to us. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We are listening to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: At the end of 1942 I was taken to Germany, and I,
together with a French doctor, had the opportunity of meeting the
chauffeur of the German physician who was head of the infirmary
where I was at that time. This soldier, whose name I have forgotten,
said to me as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In Poland, in a town the name of which I have forgotten, a
sergeant from our regiment went with a Jewess. A few hours
later he was found dead. Then”—said the German soldier—“my
battalion was called out. Half of it cordoned off the
ghetto, and the other half, two companies, to one of which
I belonged, forced its way into the houses and threw out of
the windows, pell-mell, the furniture and the inhabitants.”—The
German soldier finished his story by saying—“Poor fellow!
It was terrible, horrible!”—We asked him then—“How
could you do such a thing?”—He gave us the fatalistic reply—“Orders
are orders.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the example which I previously mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If I remember rightly, when speaking of Rawa-Ruska
you started describing the treatment of Russian prisoners
who were in this camp before you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes. That is correct. The first French batch, which
arrived in Rawa-Ruska the 14th or 15th of April 1942, followed a
group of 400 Russian prisoners of war, who were the survivors of
a detachment of 6,000 men decimated by typhus. The few medicines
found by the French doctors upon arrival at Rawa-Ruska came from
the infirmary of the Russian prisoners. There were a few aspirin
tablets and other drugs; absolutely nothing against typhus. The
camp had not been disinfected after the sick Russians had left.
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot speak here of these wretched Russian survivors of
Rawa-Ruska, without asking the Tribunal for permission to describe
the terrible picture we all—I mean all the French prisoners who
were in the stalags of Germany in the autumn or winter of 1941—saw
when the first batches of Russian prisoners arrived. It was on
a Sunday afternoon that I watched this spectacle, which was like a
nightmare. The Russians arrived in rows, five by five, holding each
other by the arms, as none of them could walk by themselves—“walking
skeletons” was really the only fitting expression. Since
then we have seen photographs of those camps of deportation and
death. Our unfortunate Russian comrades had been in that condition
since 1941. The color of their faces was not even yellow, it
was green. Almost all squinted, as they had not strength enough to
focus their sight. They fell by rows, five men at a time. The Germans
rushed on them and beat them with rifle butts and whips. As it
was Sunday afternoon the prisoners were at liberty, inside the
camp, of course. Seeing that, all the French started shouting and
the Germans made us return to the barracks. Typhus spread immediately
in the Russian camp, where, out of the 10,000 who had
arrived in November, only 2,500 survived by the beginning of
February.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These figures are accurate. I have them from two sources. First,
from a semi-official source, which was the kitchen of the camp. In
front of the kitchen a big chart was posted where the Germans
recorded the ridiculously small rations and the number of men in
the camp. This number decreased daily by 80 to 100, in the Russian
camp. On the other hand, French comrades employed in the camp’s
reception office, called “Aufnahme,” also knew the figures, and from
them I got the figure of 2,500 survivors in February. Later, particularly
at Rawa-Ruska, I had the opportunity of seeing French prisoners
from all parts of Germany. All those who were in stalags,
that is, in the central camps, at the time mentioned, saw the same
thing. Many of the Russian prisoners were thrown in a common
grave, even before they were dead. The dead and the dying were
piled up between the barracks and thrown into carts. The first few
days we could see the corpses in the carts, but as the German camp
commandant did not like to see French soldiers salute their fallen
Russian comrades, he had them covered with canvas after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were your camps guarded by the German Army
or by the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: By the Wehrmacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Only by the German Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I was never guarded by anybody but the German Army
and once by the Schutzpolizei, after I had tried to escape.
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: And were you recaptured?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: One last question. You were kept in a number
of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany, were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: In all those camps did you have the opportunity
to practice your religion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: In the camps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What is your religion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I am a Protestant. In the camps where I was kept,
Protestants and Catholics were generally allowed to practice their
religion. But I was detailed to working squads, particularly to an
agricultural group in the Bremen district, called “Maiburg,” I think,
where there was a Catholic priest. There were about sixty of us in
this group. This Catholic priest could not say Mass—they would not
let him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: The sentries—the “Posten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Who were soldiers of the German Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, always.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the British Prosecutor wish to ask any
questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BRITISH PROSECUTOR: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Or the United States?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AMERICAN PROSECUTOR: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the Defense Counsel wish to ask
any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Witness, when were you taken prisoner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I was taken prisoner on 14 June 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: In which camp for prisoners of war were you put?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I was immediately sent to the Oflag, XI D, at Grossborn-Westfalenhof
in Pomerania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Oflag?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: What regulations were made known to you in the
prisoner-of-war camp regarding a possible attempt at escape?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: We were warned that we would be shot at and that we
should not try to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Do you think that this warning was in agreement
with the Geneva Convention?
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: This one certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: You mentioned, if I heard correctly, the case of
Robin from Oflag XI D. You said that there was an officer who dug
a tunnel in order to escape from the camp, and that as he was the
first to emerge from the tunnel, he was shot. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes; I said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Were you with those officers who tried to escape?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I said before that this was related to me by Lieutenant
Ledoux who was still in Oflag XI D when that happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I only wanted to ascertain that this officer, Robin,
met his death while trying to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, but here I should like to mention one thing, namely,
all the prisoners of war who escaped knew they risked their lives.
Everyone attempting to escape, knew that he risked a bullet. But
it is one thing to be killed trying to climb the barbed wire, for
instance, and it is another thing to be ambushed and murdered at
a moment when one cannot do anything, when one is unarmed and
at the mercy of somebody, as was the case with Lieutenant Robin.
He was in a low tunnel, flat on his stomach, crawling along, and
was killed. That was not in accordance with international rules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I see what you mean, and you may rest assured
that I respect every prisoner of war who tried to do his duty as a
patriot. In this case, however, which you did not witness, I wanted
to make the point that this courageous officer who left the tunnel
might not have answered when challenged by the guards and was
therefore shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Though you have just given a vivid description
of the incident, I think it was a product of your imagination because,
according to your own testimony, you did not see it yourself; is that
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: There are not 36 different ways of getting out of an
escape tunnel: You lie flat on your stomach, you crawl, and if you
are killed before you get out of the tunnel, I call that murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: And then you saw the officer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, we do not want argument in cross-examination.
The witness has already stated that he was not there
and did not see it, and he has explained the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Thank you. The incident in respect to Lieutenant
Thomson is not quite clear to me. In this case too, I believe you
said you had no direct knowledge, but were informed by a friend.
Is that correct?
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I cannot but repeat what I said before. I related the
story of the French lieutenant, Ledoux, who told me that he was in
the fortress of Graudenz together with an R.A.F. lieutenant called
Anthony Thomson. This English officer escaped from the fortress.
He was recaptured on the airfield, taken back to the fortress, put
into the same cell as Lieutenant Ledoux, and Ledoux saw him killed
by a revolver shot in the back of the neck. Ledoux gave me the
name of the murderer. I think I mentioned him just now, Hauptfeldwebel
Ostereich. This is the story told me by an eyewitness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Was that Hauptfeldwebel Ostereich a guard at the
camp, or to what formation did he belong?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I don’t know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Do you know that you, as prisoner of war, had a
right to complain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Certainly; I personally knew the Geneva Convention
which was signed by Germany in 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Knowing those regulations you also knew, did you
not, that you could complain to the camp commander? Did you
avail yourself of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I tried to do so, but without success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: May I ask you for the name of the camp commander
who refused to hear you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I do not know the name, but I will tell you when I
tried to complain. It was when I was in the infamous Linzburg
Strafkommando (punishment squad) in the province of Hanover.
This squad belonged to Stalag XC. In the morning following the
night I have just described, when, after an unsuccessful attempt at
escape, we were beaten for 3 hours running, some of us were kept
in the barracks. We then saw the immediate superior of the commander
of the squad. It was an Oberleutnant, whose name I do not
know, who saw that we were injured, particularly about the head,
and he considered it quite all right. In the afternoon we went to
work. When we returned at 7 o’clock we had the visit of a major,
a very distinguished-looking man, who also thought that, as we had
tried to escape, it was quite in order that we should be punished.
As to our complaint, it went no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Did you know that the German Government had
made an agreement with the Vichy Government regarding prisoners
of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, I have heard of that, but they did not inspect
squads of this kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: You mean to say that only the camps were inspected,
but not the labor squads?
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: There were inspections of the labor squads, but not of
the punishment squads where I was. That is the difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: You were not always in a disciplinary squad,
were you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: When were you put in a disciplinary squad?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: In April 1941, for the first time. It was a squad to which
only officer cadets and priests were sent without any obvious
reasons. This was the Linzburg Strafkommando squad which did
not receive any visits. At Rawa-Ruska we received the visit of two
Swiss doctors; I think it was in September 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: In September 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, in September 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Did you complain to the Swiss doctors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Not I personally, but our spokesman was able to talk
to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: And were there any results?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Do you not think that a complaint made through
the camp commander would likewise have been successful, if you
had wished to resort to it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: We were not on very friendly terms with the German
staff at Rawa-Ruska.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I do not quite understand you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: I said we were not on friendly terms with the German
commander of the Rawa-Ruska Camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: It is not a question of good terms, but of a complaint
which could be made in an official manner. Do you not
think so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness shrugged his shoulders.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: When did you leave Rawa-Ruska?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: At the end of October 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: If I remember rightly, you mentioned the number
of victims counted or observed by you, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: How many victims were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: It was a figure given to me by Dr. Lievin, a French
doctor at Rawa-Ruska. There were, as I said, about sixty deaths
in the camp itself, to which approximately one hundred must be
added who disappeared.
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Are you speaking of French victims or victims in
general?</p>

<p class='pindent'>ROSER: When I was at Rawa-Ruska there were only Frenchmen
there, with a few Poles and a few Belgians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I am putting this question because an official
French report I have before me, dated 14 June 1945, states that the
victims up to the end of July were 14 Frenchmen, and therefore
for the period from August to September the number seems to me
very high. Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other German counsel want to put
any questions to this witness? [<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>] M. Dubost?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have finished with this witness, Mr. President.
If the Tribunal will permit me, I shall now call another witness, the
last one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment, M. Dubost, the witness can
retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Dubost, could you tell the Tribunal whether the witness you
are about to call is going to give us any evidence of a different
nature from the evidence which has already been given? Because
you will remember that we have in the French document, of which
we shall take judicial notice—a very large French document; I
forget the number, 321 I believe it is, Document Number RF-321;
we have a very large volume of evidence on the conditions in concentration
camps. Is the witness you are going to call going to
prove anything fresh?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your Honors, the witness whom we are going to
call is to testify to a certain number of experiments which he witnessed.
He has even submitted certain documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are these experiments about which the
witness is going to speak all recorded, in the Document Number
RF-321?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They are referred to, but not reported in detail.
Moreover, in view of the importance attached to statements of witnesses
in the French presentation concerning the camps, I shall considerably
curtail my work and will dispense with reading the
documentary evidence, a large amount of which I shall merely
submit after these witnesses have been heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may call the witness, but try not to let
him be too long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall do my best, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Dr. Alfred Balachowsky, took the stand.</span>]
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED BALACHOWSKY (Witness): Alfred Balachowsky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you French?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you take this oath? Do you swear to
speak without hate or fear, to say the truth, all the truth, only
the truth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raise your right hand and swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit if you wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your name is Balachowsky, Alfred B-a-l-a-c-h-o-w-s-k-y?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are head of a laboratory at the Pasteur
Institute in Paris?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Your residence is at Viroflay? You were born
15 August 1909 at Korotcha in Russia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You are French?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: By birth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Russian by birth, French by naturalization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: When were you naturalized?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: 1932.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were you deported on 16 January 1944 after being
arrested on 2 July 1943, and were you 6 months in prison first at
Fresnes, then at Compiègne? Were you then transferred to the
Dora Camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Can you tell us rapidly what you know about the
Dora Camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The Dora Camp is situated 5 kilometers north
of the town of Nordhausen, in southern Germany. This camp was
considered by the Germans as a secret detachment, a Geheimkommando,
which prisoners who were kept there could never leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This secret detachment had as its task the manufacture of V-1’s
and V-2’s—the “Vergeltungswaffen” (reprisal weapons)—the aerial
torpedoes which the Germans launched on England. That is why
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
Dora was a secret detachment. The camp was divided into two
parts: one outer part contained one-third of the total number of
persons in the camp, and the remaining two-thirds were concentrated
in the underground factory. Dora, consequently, was an
underground factory for the manufacture of V-1’s and V-2’s. I
arrived at Dora on 10 February 1944, coming from Buchenwald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Please speak more slowly. You arrived at Dora
from Buchenwald on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: On 10 February 1944, that is at a time when
life in the Dora Camp was particularly hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 February we were loaded, 76 men, onto a large German
lorry. We were forced to crouch down, four SS guards occupying
the seats at the front of the lorry. As we could not all crouch down,
being too many, whenever a man raised his head he got a blow
with a rifle butt, so that in the course of our 4-hour journey several
of us were injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After our arrival at Dora, we spent a whole day and night without
food, in the cold, in the snow, waiting for all the formalities of
registration in the camp—completing forms, with names and surnames,
and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In comparison with Buchenwald, we found a considerable change
at Dora, as the general management of the Dora Camp was entrusted
to a special category of prisoners who were criminals. These
criminals were our block leaders, served our soup, and looked after
us. In contrast to the political prisoners who wore a red triangular
badge, these criminals were distinguished by a green triangular
badge on which was a black S. We called them the “S” men
(Sicherheitsverband). They were people convicted of crimes by
German courts long before the war, but who, instead of being sent
home after having served their terms, were kept for life in concentration
camps to supervise the other prisoners. Needless to say
prisoners of that kind, these criminals with the green triangles,
were asocial elements. Sometimes they had been 5, 10, even 20 years
in prison, and afterwards, 5 or 10 years in concentration camps.
These asocial outcasts no longer had any hope of ever getting out
of the concentration camps. These criminals, however, thanks to
the support and co-operation they were offered by the SS management
of the camp, now had the chance of a career. This career
consisted in stealing from and robbing the other prisoners, and
obtaining from them the maximum output demanded by the SS.
They beat us from morning till night. We got up at 4 o’clock in
the morning and had to be ready within 5 minutes in the underground
dormitories where we were crammed, without ventilation
in foul air, in blocks about as large as this room, into which 3,000
to 3,500 internees were crowded. There were five tiers of bunks
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
with rotting straw mattresses. Fresh ones were never issued. We
were given 5 minutes in which to get up, for we went to bed completely
dressed. We were hardly able to get any sleep, for there
was a continuous coming and going, and all sorts of thefts took
place among the prisoners. Furthermore, it was impossible to sleep
because we were covered with lice; the whole Dora Camp swarmed
with vermin. It was virtually impossible to get rid of the lice. In
5 minutes we had to be in line in the tunnel and march to a given
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To the witness</span>] Just a minute, please. M.
Dubost, you said you were going to call this witness upon experiments.
He is now giving us all the details of camp life which we
have already heard on several occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: So far nobody has spoken about the Dora Camp,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but every camp we have heard of has
got the same sort of brutalities, hasn’t it, according to the witnesses
who have been called?</p>

<p class='pindent'>You were going to call this witness because he was going to deal
with experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: If the Tribunal is convinced that all the camps had
the same regime, then my point has been proved and the witness
will now testify to the experiments at the Buchenwald Camp. However,
I wanted to show that all German camps were the same. I
think this has now been proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you were going to prove that, you would
have to call a witness from every camp, and there are hundreds
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This question has to be proved because it is the
uniformity of the system which establishes the culpability of these
defendants. In every camp there was one responsible person who
was the camp commander. But we are not trying the camp commander,
but the defendants here in the dock and we are trying
them for having conceived .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have already pointed out to you that there
has been practically no cross-examination, and I have asked you to
confine this witness, as far as possible, to the question of experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The witness will then confine himself to experiments
at Buchenwald as this is the Tribunal’s wish. The Tribunal
will consider the uniformity of treatment in all German internment
camps as proved.
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness</span>] Will you now testify to the criminal
practices of the SS Medical Corps in the camps, criminal practices
in the form of scientific experiments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I was recalled to Buchenwald the 1st of
May 1944, and assigned to Block 50, which was actually a factory
for the manufacture of vaccines against exanthematous typhus. I
was recalled from Dora to Buchenwald, because, in the meantime,
the management of the camp had learned that I was a specialist
in this sort of research, and consequently they wished to utilize
my services in Block 50 for the manufacture of vaccines. However,
I was unaware of it until the very last moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came to Block 50 on the 1st of May 1944, and I stayed there
until the liberation of the camp on the 11th of April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Block 50, which was the block where vaccines were manufactured,
was under Sturmbannführer Schuler, who was a doctor
with the rank of a Sturmbannführer, equal to SS major. He was
in charge of the block and was responsible for the manufacture
of the vaccines. This same Sturmbannführer Schuler was also in
charge of another block in the Buchenwald Camp. This other
block was Block 46, the infamous block for experiments, where
the internees were utilized as guinea pigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blocks 46 and 50 were both run by one office; it was the “Geschäftszimmer.”
All archives, index cards pertaining to the experiments—as
well as Block 50, were sent to the Geschäftszimmer,
that is, to the office of Block 50.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secretary of Block 50 was an Austrian political prisoner,
my friend, Eugene Kogon. He and a few other comrades had,
consequently, opportunities of looking through all the archives of
which they had charge. Therefore they were able to know, day
by day, exactly what went on either in Block 50, our block, or
in Block 46. I myself was able to get hold of most of the archives
of Block 46, and even the book in which the experiments were
recorded has been saved. It is in our possession, and has been
forwarded to the Psychological Service of the American Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this book all experiments are entered which were made in
Block 46. Block 46 was established in October 1941 by a high commission
subordinate to the medical service of the Waffen SS; and
we see as members of its administrative council, a certain number
of names, for this Block 46 came under the Research Section
Number 5 (Versuchsabteilung Number 5 of Leipzig) of the Supreme
Command of the Waffen SS. Inspector Mrugowski, Obergruppenführer
of the Waffen SS, was in charge of this section. The
administrative council which set up Block 46 was composed of the
following members:
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Genzken, Obergruppenführer (the highest rank in the
Waffen SS); Dr. Poppendiek, Gruppenführer of the Waffen SS; and
finally we see among these names also that of Dr. Handloser of
the Wehrmacht and of the Military Academy of Berlin, who was
also associated with the initiation of experiments on human beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in this administrative council there were members of
the SS, and also Dr. Handloser. The experiments proper were
carried out by Sturmbannführer Schuler, but all the orders and
directives concerning the different types of experiments, which I
shall speak about to you, were issued by Leipzig, that is, by the
Research Section (Versuchsabteilung) of the Waffen SS. So there
was no personal initiative on the part of Schuler or the management
of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the experiments, all orders came directly from the
Supreme Command in Berlin. Among these experiments, which we
could follow step by step (at least some of them) through the cards,
the results, the registration number of people admitted to and
discharged from Block 46, were, first of all, numerous exanthematous
typhus experiments; second, experiments on phosphorus burns;
third, experiments on sexual hormones; fourth, experiments on
starvation edema or avitaminosis; finally, fifth, I can tell you of
experiments in the field of forensic medicine. So we have five
different types of experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were the men who were subjected to these
experiments volunteers or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The human beings subjected to experiments
were recruited, not only in the Buchenwald Camp, but also outside
the camp. They were not volunteers; in most cases they did not
know that they would be used for experiments until they entered
Block 46. The recruitment took place among criminals, perhaps in
order to reduce their large numbers in that way. But the recruitment
was also carried out among political prisoners and I have
to point out that recruits for Block 46 came also from Russian
prisoners of war. Among the political prisoners and prisoners of
war who were used for experimental purposes at Block 46, the
Russians were always in the majority, for the following reasons:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the prisoners who could exist in concentration camps it
was the Russians who had the greatest physical resistance, which
was obviously superior to that of the French or other people of
western Europe. They could withstand hunger and ill-treatment,
and, generally speaking, showed physical resistance in every
respect. For this particular reason, Russian political prisoners were
recruited for experiments in greater numbers than others. However,
there were people of other nationalities among them, particularly
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
French. I should now like to deal with details of the experiments
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do not go too much into details, because we are
not specialists. It will suffice us to know that these experiments
were carried out without any regard to humanity and on nonvoluntary
subjects. Will you please describe to us the atrocious character
of these experiments and their results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The experiments carried out in Block 46 did
without doubt serve a medical purpose, but for the greater part
they were of no service to science. Therefore, they can hardly be
called experiments. The men were used for observing the effects
of drugs, poisons, bacterial cultures, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. I take, as an example,
the use of vaccine against exanthematous typhus. To manufacture
this vaccine it is necessary to have bacterial cultures of typhus.
For experiments such as are carried out at the Pasteur Institute
and the other similar institutes of the world, cultures are not
necessary as typhus patients can always be found for samples of
infected blood. Here it was quite different. From the records and
the chart you have in hand, we could ascertain in Block 46
12 different cultures of typhus germs, designated by the letter BU,
(meaning Buchenwald) and numbered Buchenwald 1 to Buchenwald
12. A constant supply of these cultures was kept in Block 46
by means of the contamination of healthy individuals through sick
ones; this was achieved by artificial inoculation of typhus germs
by means of intravenous injections of 0.5 to 1 cubic centimeter
of infected blood drawn from a patient at the height of the crisis.
Now, it is well-known that artificial inoculation of typhus by
intravenous injection is invariably fatal. Therefore all these men
who were used for bacterial culture during the whole time such
cultures were required (from October 1942 to the liberation of the
camp) died, and we counted 600 victims sacrificed for the sole
purpose of supplying typhus germs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They were literally murdered to keep typhus
germs alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: They were literally murdered to keep typhus
germs alive. Apart from these, other experiments were made as to
the efficacy of vaccines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What is this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: This document contains a record of the
typhus cultures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This document was taken by you from the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, I took this document from the camp,
and its contents were summarized by me in the experiment book of
Block 46.
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Is this the document you handed to us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: We have actually made a more complete
document—which is in the possession of the American Psychological
Service—as we have the entire record, and this represents only one
page of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I ask the Tribunal to take note that the French
Prosecution submits this document, Document Number RF-334, as
appendix to the testimony of Dr. Balachowsky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: [<span class='it'>Continuing</span>] In 1944, experiments were also
made on the effects of vaccines. One hundred and fifty men lost
their lives in these experiments. The vaccines used by the German
Army were not only those manufactured in our Block 46, but also
ones which came from Italy, Denmark, Poland, and the Germans
wanted to ascertain the value of these different vaccines. Consequently,
in August 1944 they began experiments on 150 men who
were locked up in Block 46.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, I should like to tell you how this Block 46 was run. It
was entirely isolated and surrounded by barbed wire. The internees
had no roll call and no permission to go out. All the windows
were kept closed, the panes were of frosted glass. No unauthorized
person could enter the block. A German political prisoner was in
charge of the Block. This German political prisoner was Kapo
Dietzsch, an asocial individual who had been in prisons and in
camps for 20 years and who worked for the SS. It was he who
gave the injections and the inoculations and who executed people
upon order. Strangely enough, there were weapons in the block,
automatic pistols, and hand grenades, to quell any possible revolt,
either outside or inside the block.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can also tell you that an order slip for Block 46, sent to the
office (Geschäftszimmer) at Block 50 in January 1945, mentioned
three strait jackets to be used for those who refused to be
inoculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I come back to the typhus and vaccine experiments. You
will see how they were carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 150 prisoners were divided into 2 groups: those who were
to be used as tests and those who were to be the subjects. The
latter only received (ordinary) injections of the different types of
vaccines to be tested. Those used for testing were not given any
injections. Then, after the vaccination of the subjects, inoculations
were given (always by means of intravenous injections) to everybody
selected for this experiment, those for testing as well as the
subjects. Those used for tests died about two weeks after the
inoculation—as such is approximately the period required before
the disease develops to its fatal issue. As for the others, who
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
received different kinds of vaccines, their deaths were in proportion
to the efficacy of the vaccines administered to them. Some vaccines
had excellent results, with a very low death rate—such was the
case with the Polish vaccines. Others, on the contrary, had a much
higher death rate. After the conclusion of the experiments, no
survivors were allowed to live, according to the custom prevailing
in Block 46. All the survivors of the experiments were “liquidated”
and murdered in Block 46, by the customary methods which some
of my comrades have already described to you, that is by means
of intracardiac injections of phenol. Intracardiac injections of
10 cubic centimeters of pure phenol was the usual method of
extermination in Buchenwald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We are not really concerned here with the
proportion of the particular injections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Will you repeat that please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As I have said, we are not really concerned
here with the proportions in which these injections were given,
and will you kindly not deal with these details?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You might try and confine the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: [<span class='it'>Continuing</span>] Then I will speak of other
details which may interest you. They are experiments of a
psychotherapeutic nature, utilization of chemical products to cure
typhus, in Block 46, under the same conditions as before. German
industries co-operated in these experiments, notably the I. G. Farben
Industrie which supplied a certain number of drugs to be used for
experiments in Block 46. Among the professors who supplied the
drugs, knowing that they would be used in Block 46 for experimental
purposes, was Professor Lautenschläger of Frankfurt. So
much for the question of typhus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to experiments with phosphorus, particularly made
on prisoners of Russian origin. Phosphorus burns were inflicted in
Block 46 on Russian prisoners for the following reason. Certain
bombs dropped in Germany by the Allied aviators caused burns
on the civilians and soldiers which were difficult to heal.
Consequently, the Germans tried to find a whole series of drugs
which would hasten the healing of the wounds caused by these
burns. Thus, experiments were carried out in Block 46 on Russian
prisoners who were artificially burned with phosphorus products
and then treated with different drugs supplied by the German
chemical industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now as to experiments on sexual hormones .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What were the results of these experiments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: All these experiments resulted in death.
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Always in death? So each experiment is equivalent
to a murder for which the SS are collectively responsible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: For which those who established this institution
are responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is the SS as a whole, and the German
medical corps in particular?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Definitely so, as the orders came from the
Versuchsabteilung 5 (Research Section 5). The SS were responsible
as the orders were issued by that section at Leipzig and, therefore,
came from the Supreme Command of the Waffen SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you. What were the results of the experiments
made on sexual hormones?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: They were less serious. Besides, these were
ridiculous experiments from the scientific point of view. There
were, at Buchenwald, a number of homosexuals, that is to say, men
who had been convicted by German tribunals for this vice. These
homosexuals were sent to concentration camps, especially to
Buchenwald, and were mixed with the other prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Especially with the so-called political prisoners,
who in reality were patriots?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: With all kinds of prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: All were in the company of these German inverts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes. They wore a pink triangle to distinguish
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Was the wearing of this triangle a well-established
custom, or on the contrary, was there much confusion in classification?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: At the very first, before my arrival, from
what I heard, order was kept with respect to triangular badges;
but when I arrived at Buchenwald, in January of 1944, there was
the greatest confusion in the badges, and many prisoners wore
no badge at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Or did they wear badges of a category different
from their own?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, this was the case with many Frenchmen,
who were sent to Buchenwald because they were ordinary criminals
and who finally wore the red triangle of political prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the color of the triangle worn by the
ordinary German criminals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: They had a green triangle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did they not wear eventually a red triangle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: No, because they had more privileges than
the others and they wore the green triangle distinctly.
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: And in the working groups?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have heard that they were all mixed up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The fact will not have escaped the Tribunal that
these questions are put to counter other questions which were asked
this morning by the Counsel for the Defense with the intent to
confuse not the Tribunal, but the witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I repeat that we had a complete conglomeration
of nationalities and categories of prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is exactly what he said, that these
triangles were completely mixed up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I think, that the statement by this second witness
will definitively enlighten the Tribunal on this point, whatever the
efforts of the Defense might be to mislead us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness</span>] Do you know anything about the fate
of tattooed men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you please tell us what you know about them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Tattooed human skins were stored in Block 2,
which was called at Buchenwald the Pathological Block.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Were there many tattooed human skins in Block 2?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: There were always tattooed human skins in
Block 2. I cannot say whether there were many, as they were
continuously being received and passed on, but there were not only
tattooed human skins, but also tanned human skins—simply
tanned, not tattooed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did they skin people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: They removed the skin and then tanned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you continue your testimony on that point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I saw SS men come out of Block 2, the Pathological
Block, carrying tanned skins under their arms. I know, from
my comrades who worked in Pathological Block 2, that there were
orders for skins; and these tanned skins were given as gifts to
certain guards and to certain visitors, who used them to bind books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We were told that Koch, who was the head at that
time, was sentenced for this practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I was not a witness of the Koch affair, which
happened before I came to the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: So that even after he left there were still tanned
and tattooed skins?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, there were constantly tanned and
tattooed skins, and when the camp was liberated by the Americans,
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
they found in the camp, in Block 2, tattooed and tanned skins on
11 April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Where were these skins tanned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: These skins were tanned in Block 2, and
perhaps also in the crematorium buildings, which were not far from
Block 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Then, according to your testimony, it was a
customary practice which continued even after Koch’s execution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, this practice continued, but I do not
know to what extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Did you witness any inspections made at the camp
by German officials, and if so, who were these officials?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I can tell you something about Dora, concerning
such visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Excuse me, I have one more thing to ask you about
the skins. Do you know anything about Koch’s conviction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I heard rumors and remarks about Koch’s
conviction from my old comrades, who were in the camp at that
time. But I personally was not a witness of the affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Never mind. It is enough for me to know that
after his conviction skins were still tanned and tattooed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: You expressly state it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Absolutely. Even after his conviction, tanned
and tattooed skins were still seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Will you tell us now what visits were made to the
camp by German officials, and who these officials were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Contacts between the outside—that is
German civilians and even German soldiers—and the interior of the
camp were made possible by departures and furloughs that some
political prisoners were able to obtain from the SS in order to
spend some time with their families; and, vice versa, there were
visits to the camp by members of the Wehrmacht. In Block 50 we
had a visit of Luftwaffe cadets. These Luftwaffe cadets, members
of the regular German armed forces, passed through the camp and
were able to see practically everything that went on there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What did they do in Block 50?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: They just came to see the equipment at the
invitation of Sturmbannführer Schuler. We received several visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: What was the equipment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Equipment for the manufacture of vaccines,
laboratory equipment.
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: There were other visits also, and some
German Red Cross nurses visited that block in October 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know the names of German personalities
who visited the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, such personalities as the Crown Prince
of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who was an Obergruppenführer of the
Waffen SS and the Chief of Police of Hesse and Thuringia, who
visited the camp on several occasions, including Block 46 as well
as Block 50. He was greatly interested in the experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Do you know what the attitude of mind of the
prisoners was shortly before their liberation by the American
forces?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The prisoners of the camp expected the
liberation to come at any moment. On the 11th of April, in the
morning, there was perfect order in the camp and exemplary
discipline. We hid, with extreme difficulty and in the greatest
secrecy, some weapons: cases of hand grenades, and about two
hundred and fifty guns which were divided in 2 lots, 1 lot of 100
guns in the hospital, and another lot of about one hundred and
fifty guns in my Block 50. As soon as the Americans began to appear
below the camp of Buchenwald, about 3 o’clock in the afternoon of
the 11th of April 1945, the political prisoners assembled in line,
seized the weapons and made prisoners of most of the SS guards
of the camp or shot all those who resisted. These guards had great
difficulty in escaping as they carried rucksacks filled with booty—objects
they had stolen from the prisoners during the time they
guarded the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you. I have no further questions to put to
the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for ten minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel want to
ask any questions of this witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Are you a specialist in research concerning
the manufacture of vaccines?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, I am a specialist in matters of research.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: According to your opinion, was there any
sense in the treatment to which these people were subjected?
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: It had no scientific significance; it only had a
practical purpose. It permitted the verification of the efficacy of
certain products.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: You must have your own opinion, as you
were in contact with these men. Did you really see these people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I saw these people at very close hand, since
in Block 50 I was in charge of a part of this manufacture of
vaccine. Consequently, I was quite able to realize what kind of
experiments were being made in Block 46 and the reasons for these
experiments. Further, I also realized the almost complete
inefficiency of the SS doctors and how easy it was for us to
sabotage the vaccine for the German Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Now, these people must have gone through
much misery and suffering before they died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: These people certainly suffered terribly,
especially in the case of certain experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Can you certify that through your own
experience, or is that just hearsay?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I saw in Block 50 photographs taken in
Block 46 of phosphorus burns, and it was not necessary to be a
specialist to realize what these patients, whose flesh was burned to
the bone, must have suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Then, your conscience certainly revolted at
these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Absolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Well then, I would like to ask you, how
your conscience allowed you to obey orders to help these people in
some way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: That is quite simple. When I arrived at
Buchenwald as a deportee, I did not hide my qualifications. I simply
specified that I was a “laborant”—that is a man who is trained in
laboratory work, but who has no special definite qualification. I
was sent to Dora, where the SS regime made me lose 30 kilos in
weight in two months. I became anaemic .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Witness, I am just concerned with Buchenwald.
I do not wish to know anything about Dora. I ask you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: It was the prisoners at Buchenwald who, by
their connections within the camp, were the cause of my return
to the Buchenwald Camp. It was M. Julien Cain, a Frenchman, the
Director of the French National Library, who called my presence
to the attention of a German political prisoner, Walter Kummelschein,
who was a secretary in Block 50. He drew attention to my
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
presence without my knowing it and without my having spoken
in Dora of being a French specialist. That is the reason why the
SS called me back from Dora to work in Block 50.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Please pardon the interruption. We do not
wish to elaborate too much on these matters. I believe everything
that you have just said is true—the reason why you were sent to
Dora and why you were sent back to Buchenwald—but my point is
a completely different one. I would like to ask you once more: You
knew that these men were practically martyrs. Is that correct?
Please answer yes or no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I will answer the question. When I arrived
at Block 50 I knew nothing, either of the Block 50 or of the
experiments. It was only later when I was in Block 50, that little
by little, and through the acquaintances I was able to make in the
block, I found out the details of the experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Very well. And after you had learned about
the details of the experiments, as you were a doctor, did you not
feel great pity for these poor creatures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: My pity was very great, but it was not a
question of having pity or not; one had to carry out to the letter
the orders that were given, or be killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Very well. Then you are stating that if in
any way you had not followed the orders that you had received
you might have been killed? Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: There is no doubt about that. On the other
hand, my work consisted in manufacturing vaccine, and neither I
nor any other prisoners in Block 50 could ever enter Block 46 and
actually witness experiments. We knew what went on concerning
the experiments only through the index cards which were sent from
Block 46 to be officially registered in Block 50.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Very well, but I do not think it makes any
difference to one’s conscience whether one sees suffering with one’s
own eyes, or whether one has direct knowledge that in the same
camp people are being murdered in such a way. Now, I come to
another question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was that a question you were putting there?
Will you confine yourself to questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I beg your pardon. I should like to answer
the last question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: That was not a question. I will put another
question now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I should like to reply to this remark then.
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I am not interested in your answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I am anxious to give it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Answer the question, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Suffering was everywhere in the camps, and
not only in the experimental blocks. It was in the quarantine blocks;
it was among all the men who died every day by the hundreds.
Suffering reigned everywhere in the concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Were there any injunctions that there was
to be no talk about these experiments?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: As a rule the experiments were kept absolutely
secret. An indiscreet remark with regard to the experiments
might entail immediate death. I must add that there were very
few of us who knew the details of these experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: You mentioned visits to this camp, and you
also mentioned that German Red Cross nurses, and members of the
Wehrmacht visited the camp, and that furloughs were granted to
political prisoners. Were you ever present at one of these visits
inside the camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: Yes, I was present at the visits inside the
camp of which I spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Did the visitors at this camp see that cardiac
injections were being given? Or did the visitors see that human skin
was tanned? Did those visitors witness any ill-treatment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I cannot answer this question in the affirmative,
and I can say only that visitors passed through my block.
One had to pass almost through the entire camp. I do not know
where the visitors went either before or after visiting my block.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Did one of your own comrades tell you
perhaps whether the visitors personally saw these excesses? Yes or no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I do not understand the question. Would you
mind repeating it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Did perhaps one of your comrades tell you
that the visitors at the camp were present at these excesses?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I never heard that visitors were present at
experiments or witnessed excesses of that kind. The only thing I
can say, concerning the tanned skins is that I saw, with my own
eyes, SS noncommissioned officers or officers—I cannot remember
exactly whether they were officers or noncommissioned officers—come
out of Block 2, carrying tanned skins under their arms. But
these were SS men; they were not visitors to the camp.
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Did these visitors, and in particular Red
Cross nurses, know that these experiments were medically completely
worthless, or did they just wish to inspect the laboratories
and the equipment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I repeat again that these visitors came to my
laboratory section, where they saw what was being done, that is,
the sterilized filling of the phials. I cannot say what they saw
before or after. I know only that these visitors of whom I am
speaking, the Luftwaffe cadets or the Red Cross people, visited the
whole installation of the block. They certainly knew, however, what
was the source of this culture, and that men might be used for
experiments, as there were charts and graphs showing the stages
of cultures originating with men; but it could have been from blood
initially taken from typhus patients and not necessarily from
patients artificially inoculated with typhus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I really think that these visitors did not generally know about
the atrocities in the form of experiments that were being performed
in Block 46, but it was impossible for visitors who went into the
camp not to see the horrible conditions in which the prisoners
were kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Do you perhaps know whether people who
received leave, that is, inmates who temporarily were permitted to
leave the camp, were permitted to speak about their experiences
inside the camp and relate these experiences to the outside world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: All the concentration camps were, after all,
vast transit camps. The inmates were constantly changing, passing
from one camp to another, coming and going. Consequently there
were always new faces. But most of the time, apart from those
whom we knew before our arrest, or a few other comrades, we
knew nothing about those who came and went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Perhaps I did not express myself clearly.
I mean the following: As you said before, political prisoners were
permitted to leave the camp temporarily from time to time. Did
these inmates know about these excesses, and if they did know,
were they permitted to speak about these experiments in the rest
of Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The political prisoners (very few and all of
German nationality) who ever obtained leave were prisoners whom
the SS had entrusted with important posts in the camp and who
had been imprisoned for at least 10 years in the camp. This was so,
for instance, in the case of Karl, the Kapo, head of the canteen of
the Buchenwald Camp, the canteen of the Waffen SS, who was
responsible for the canteen. He was given a fortnight’s leave to
visit his family at his home in the town of Zeitz. Consequently this
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
Kapo was free for 10 days and was able to tell his family anything
he wanted to; but I do not know, of course, what he did. What I
can say is that obviously he had to be careful. In any case, the
prisoners who were allowed to leave the camp were old inmates,
as I have said, who knew approximately everything that was going
on, including the experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Now, one last question. If I assume that the
people you just described told anything to members of their families,
even on the pledge of secrecy, and the leaders of the camp
came to know of these indiscretions, do you not believe that the
death penalty might have been incurred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: If there were indiscretions of that kind on
the part of the family (for such indiscretions may be repeated
among one’s acquaintances), or at least, if such indiscretions came
to the knowledge of the SS, it is obvious that those prisoners risked
the death penalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there any other Defense Counsel who
wants to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I protest against the prosecutor’s declaration that
I tried to confuse witnesses with my questions. I am not here to
worry about the good opinion or otherwise of the press, but to do
my duty as a defense attorney .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are going too fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: [<span class='it'>Continuing</span>] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I am of the opinion that
things should not be made more difficult by anyone taking part in
this Trial—not even the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This war has brought me so much misfortune and sorrow that
I have no reason to vindicate anyone who was responsible for this
personal suffering or for the misfortune that fell on all our people.
I will not try to prevent any such person from receiving his proper
punishment. I am concerned only with helping the Tribunal to
determine the truth, so that just sentences may be pronounced, and
that innocent people may not be condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Kindly resume your seat. It is not fit for you
to make a speech. You have been making a speech, as I understood
it; this is not the occasion for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I find it necessary because I was not protected
against the Prosecution’s reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Herr Babel left the stand to resume his seat.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment; come back. I do not know
what you mean about not being protected. Well! Listen to me. I
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
don’t know what you mean by not being protected against the
Prosecution. The Prosecution called this witness and the defendants’
counsel had the fullest opportunity to cross-examine, and we
understood you went to the Tribunal for the purpose of cross-examining
the witness. I do not understand your protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Your Honor, unfortunately I do not know the
court procedure customary in England, America, and other countries.
According to the German penal code and to German trial regulations,
it is customary that unjustified and unfounded attacks of this
kind made against a participant of a trial are rejected by the
presiding judge. I therefore expected that perhaps this would be
done here too, but as it did not happen, I took the occasion to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
If by doing so, I violated the rules of court procedure, I beg to be
excused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What unjust accusations are you referring to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The Prosecuting Attorney implied that I put
questions to witnesses calculated to confuse them, in order to prevent
the witnesses from testifying in a proper manner. This is an
accusation against the Defense which is an insult to us, at least to
myself—I do not know what the attitude of the other Defense
Counsel is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid I do not understand what you
mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Your Honor, I am sorry. I think I cannot convince
you as you probably do not know this aspect of German
mentality, for our German regulations are entirely different. I do
not wish to reproach our President in any way. I merely wanted
to point out that I consider this accusation unjust and that I reject it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, I understand you are saying that
the Prosecuting Attorney said something to you? Now, what is it
you say the Prosecuting Attorney said to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The Prosecuting Attorney said that I wanted to
confuse witnesses by my questions and, in my opinion that means
I am doing something improper. I am not here to confuse witnesses,
but to assist the Court to find the truth, and this cannot be done
by confusing the witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I understand now. I do not think that the
Prosecuting Attorney meant to make accusations against your professional
conduct at all. If that is only what you wish to say, I
quite understand the point you wish to make. Do you want to ask
this witness any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Yes, I have one question. [<span class='it'>Turning to the
witness</span>] You testified that weapons, 50 guns, if I understood
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
correctly, were brought into either Block 46 or 50. Who brought
these weapons in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: We, the prisoners, brought them in and hid
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: For what purpose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: To save our skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I did not understand you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: I said that we hid these guns because we
meant to sell our lives dearly at the last moment—that is, to defend
ourselves to the death rather than be exterminated, as were most of
our comrades in the camps, with flame-throwers and machine guns.
In that case we would have defended ourselves with the guns we
had hidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You said “we prisoners”; who were these
prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The internees inside the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What internees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: We, the political prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: They were supposed to have been mostly German
concentration camp prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: They were of all nationalities. Unknown to
the SS, there was an international secret defense organization with
shock battalions within the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: There were German concentration camp prisoners
who wanted to help you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: German prisoners also belonged to these shock
battalions—German political prisoners, and in particular former
German Communists who had been imprisoned for 10 years and
who were of great help towards the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Very well, that’s what I wanted to know. Then,
with the exception of the criminal who wore the green triangle,
you and the other inmates, even these of German origin, were on
friendly terms and helped each other; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The question of the “greens” did not arise,
because the SS evacuated the “greens” in the last few days before
the liberation of the camp. They exterminated most of them; in
any case they left the camp, and we do not know what became of
them. No doubt some are still hiding among the German population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: My question did not refer to those with the
green badges, but to your relations with the German political
prisoners.
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BALACHOWSKY: The political prisoners, whether they were
German, French, Russian, Dutch, Belgian or from Luxembourg,
formed inside the camp secret shock battalions which took up arms
at the last minute, and took part in the liberation of the camp.
The arms that were hidden came from the Gustloff armament
factory, which was located near the camp. These arms were stolen
by the workers employed in this factory, who every day brought
back with them either a butt hidden in their clothes, or a gun barrel,
or a breech. And, in secret, with much difficulty, the guns were
assembled from the different pieces and hidden. These were the
guns we used in the last days of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Thank you. I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other German counsel wish to ask
questions? Have you any questions, M. Dubost?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have no further questions, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: These two days of testimony will obviate my
reading the documents any further, since it seems established in
the eyes of the Tribunal, that the excesses, ill-treatment, and
crimes which our witnesses have described to you, occurred repeatedly
and were identical in all the camps; and therefore are evidence of a
higher will originating in the government itself, a systematic will
of extermination and terror under which all occupied Europe had
to suffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore I shall submit to you only, without reading them,
the documents we have collected, and confine myself to a brief
analysis whenever they might give you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, you understand, of course, that
the Tribunal is satisfied with the evidence which it has heard up
to date; but, of course, it is expecting to hear evidence, or possibly
may hear evidence, from the defendants; and it naturally will
suspend its judgment until it has heard that evidence and, as I
pointed out to you yesterday, I think, under Article 24e of the
Charter, you will have the opportunity of applying to the Tribunal,
if you think it right to call rebuttal evidence in answer to any
evidence which the defendants may call. All I mean to indicate to
you now is that the Tribunal is not making up its mind at the
present moment. It will wait until it has heard the evidence for
the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I understand you, Mr. President, but I think that
the evidence we submitted in the form of testimony during these
2 days constitutes an essential part of our accusation. It will allow
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
us to shorten the presentation of our documents, of which we shall
simply submit an analysis or very brief extracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had stopped at the description of the transports and under
what conditions they were made, when we started calling our
witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to establish who, among the defendants, are those particularly
responsible for these transports, I present Document UK-56,
signed by Jodl and ordering the deportation of Jews from Denmark.
It appears in the first book of documents as Exhibit Number RF-335.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will now continue presenting a question which was interrupted
on Friday, when the session was suspended at 1700 hours. This
Document Number UK-56 is a telegram transmitted en clair marked
“Top Secret.” It is the 8th in the first book. Its second paragraph
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The deportation of Jews is to be carried out by the
Reichsführer SS, who is to detail two police battalions to
Denmark for this purpose.</p>
<hr class='tbk292'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Signed: Jodl.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here we have the carrying out of a political act by a military
organization or at least by a leader belonging to a military organization—the
German General Staff. This charge therefore affects both
Jodl and the German General Staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submitted under Exhibit Number RF-324 (Document Number
F-224), during the Friday afternoon session, an extract from the
report of the Dutch Government. The Tribunal will find in this
report a passage concerning the transport of Dutch Jews detained
in Westerbork—which I quote, Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All Jewish Netherlanders, whom the Germans could lay
their hands on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were brought together here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “—Paragraph
3—“Gradually all those interned in Westerbork
were deported to Poland.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is it necessary to recall the consequences of these transports,
carried out in the conditions described to you, when witnesses have
come to tell you that each time the cars were opened numerous
corpses had first to be taken out before a few survivors could be
found?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Document Number F-115 (Exhibit Number RF-336),
is the report of Professor Richet. In it Professor Richet repeats
what our witnesses have said, that there were 75 to 120 deportees
in each car. In every transport men died. The fact is known that
on arriving in Buchenwald from Compiègne, after an average
journey of 60 hours, at least 25 percent of the men had succumbed.
This testimony corroborates those of Blaha, Madame Vaillant-Couturier
and Professor Dupont.
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Blaha’s testimony appears in your document book under the
Number 3249-PS. It is the second statement of Blaha. We have
heard Blaha. I do not think it necessary to read what he has
already stated to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Especially infamous is the transport to Dachau, during the months
of August and September 1944, when numerous trains which had
left France, generally from the camps in Brittany, arrived at this
camp with four to five hundred dead out of about two thousand
men in a train. The first page of Document Number F-140 states—and
I quote so as not to have to return to it again—in the fourth
paragraph which deals with Auschwitz: “About seven million persons
died in this camp.” It repeats the conditions under which the
transports were made and which Madame Vaillant-Couturier has
described to you. On the train of 2 July 1944, which left from
Compiègne, men went mad and fought with each other and more
than six hundred of them died between Compiègne and Dachau.
It is with this convoy that Document Number F-83 deals, which we
submit as Exhibit Number RF-337, and which indicates in the minutes
of Dr. Bouvier, Rheims, 20 February 1945—that these prisoners by
the time they reached Rheims were already half-dead of thirst:
“Eight dying men were taken out already at Rheims; one of them
was a priest.” This convoy was to go to Dachau. A few kilometers
past Compiègne there were already numerous dead in every car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-32, Exhibit Number RF-331, Page 21, contains many
other examples of the atrocious conditions under which our compatriots
were transported from France to Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the station at Bremen water was refused us by the
German Red Cross.</p>
<hr class='tbk293'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We were dying of thirst. At Breslau the prisoners again
begged German Red Cross nurses to give us a little water.
They took no notice of our appeals.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To prevent escape, in disregard of the most natural and
elementary feelings of modesty, the deportees were forced in many
convoys to strip themselves of all their clothes, and they travelled
like that for many hours, entirely naked, from France to Germany.
A testimony to this effect is given by our official document already
submitted under Document Number RF-301:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“One of the means used to prevent escapes, or as reprisal for
them, was to unclothe the prisoners completely.”—And the
author of the report adds—“This reprisal was also aimed at
the moral degradation of the individual.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The most restrained testimonies report that this crowding
together of naked men barely having room to breathe, was a
horrible sight. When escapes occurred in spite of the precautions,
hostages were taken from the cars and shot. Testimony to this
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
effect is provided by the same document—five deportees were
executed:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“That was how, near Montmorency, five deportees from the
train of 15 August 1944 were buried, and five others of the
same train were killed by pistol shots by German police and
officers of the Wehrmacht at Domprémy (Marne).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Added to this quotation is that of another official document,
which we have already submitted under F-321, Exhibit Number 331:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Several young men were rapidly chosen. The moment they
reached the trench the policemen each seized a prisoner,
pushed him against the side of the trench, and fired a pistol
into the nape of his neck.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The same thing prevailed in deportations from Denmark. The
Danish Jews were particularly affected. A certain number, warned
in time, had been able to escape to Sweden with the help of Danish
patriots. Unfortunately, eight to nine thousand persons were
arrested by the Germans and deported. It is estimated that 475 of
them were transported by boat and truck under inhuman conditions
to Bohemia and Moravia to Theresienstadt. This is stated in the
Danish document submitted under Document Number F-666, Exhibit
Number RF-338.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with this country it is necessary to inform the
Tribunal of the deportation of the frontier guards:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At most places, however, the policemen were dismissed as
soon as they had been disarmed. Only in Copenhagen and
in the large provincial towns were they retained, and partly
by ship and partly by goods vans, taken southwards to
Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk294'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The policemen were taken via Neuengamme to the concentration
camp at Buchenwald. They were quartered there under
indescribably insanitary conditions; a very large proportion
of them were taken ill; about one hundred policemen and
frontier guardsmen died and several still bear traces of the
sojourn.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When these deportations had been carried out, all the citizens
of the subjugated countries of the west of Europe found themselves
in the company of their comrades of misfortune of the east, in the
concentration camps of Germany. These camps were merely a
means of realizing the policy of extermination which Germany had
pursued ever since the National Socialists seized power. This policy
of extermination would lead, according to Hitler, to installing
250 million Germans in Europe in the territories adjoining Germany,
which constituted her vital space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The police, the German Army, no longer dared to shoot their
hostages, but neither of the two had any mercy on them. More
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
and more, were transported in ever increasing numbers from 1943
to German concentration camps, where all means were used to
annihilate them—from exhausting labor to the gas chambers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Censuses taken at various times in France enable us to ascertain
that there were more than 250,000 French deportees, of which
only 35,000 returned. Document Number F-497, submitted as Exhibit
Number RF-339, indicates that out of 600,000 arrests which the Germans
made in France, 350,000 were carried out with a view to
internment in France or in Germany:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Total number deported, 250,000; number of deportees returned,
35,000.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the following page are a few names of deported French
personages.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Prefects: M. Bussières, M. Bonnefoy, disappeared in the <span class='it'>Cap
Arcona</span>, Generals: de Lestraing, executed at Dachau; Job,
executed at Auschwitz; Frère, died at Struthof; Bardi de Fourtou
died at Neuengamme; Colonel Roger Masse died at Auschwitz.</p>
<hr class='tbk295'/>
<p class='noindent'>“High officials: Marquis of Moustier, died at Neuengamme;
Bouloche, Inspector General of Roads and Bridges died at
Buchenwald; his wife died at Ravensbrück, one of his sons died
during deportation, his other son alone returned from Flossenbürg;
Jean Devèze, engineer of roads and bridges, disappeared
at Nordhausen; Pierre Block, engineer of roads and bridges,
died at Auschwitz; Mme. Getting, founder of the social
service in France, disappeared at Auschwitz.</p>
<hr class='tbk296'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Among university professors, names well-known in France,
such as: Henri Maspéro, Professor at the College de France,
died at Buchenwald; Georges Bruhat, Director of the École
Normale Supérieure, died at Oranienburg; Professor Vieille
died at Buchenwald.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible to name each of the intellectuals exterminated
by German fury. Among the doctors we must, however, mention
the disappearance of the Director of the Rothschild Hospital and
of Professor Florence, both murdered, one at Auschwitz, the other
at Neuengamme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to Holland: 110,000 Dutch citizens of the Jewish faith were
arrested, only 5,000 returned; 16,000 patriots were arrested, only
6,000 returned. Out of a total of 126,000 deportees, 11,000 were
repatriated after the liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium, there were 197,150 deportees, not including prisoners
of war; including prisoners of war, 250,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Luxembourg, 7,000 deportees—more than 700 were Jews.
There were 4,000 Luxembourgers; out of these, 500 died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Denmark (Exhibit Number RF-338, Document Number F-666
already submitted) 6,104 Danes were interned; 583 died.
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There were camps within and outside Germany. Most of the
latter were used only for the sorting of prisoners, and I have already
spoken about them. However, some of them functioned like those
in Germany and among them, that of Westerbork in Holland must
be mentioned. This camp is dealt with in Document Number F-224,
already submitted under Exhibit Number RF-324, which, is the
official report of the Dutch Government. The camp of Amersfoort,
also in Holland, is the subject of Document Number F-677, which
will be submitted as Exhibit Number RF-344.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What we already know through direct testimony of the regime
of the Nazi internment camps makes it unnecessary for me to read
the whole report, which is rather voluminous, and which does not
bring any noticeably new facts on the regime of these camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is also the camp of Vught in Holland. Then in Norway
the camps of Grini, of Falstad, of Vlven; that of Espeland, and
that of Sydspissen, which are described in a document provided by
the Norwegian Government—Document Number F-240, Exhibit
Number RF-292, which we have already submitted. The Tribunal
will excuse me for not reading this document, which does not give
us any information that we have not heard before from the witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The camps inside Germany, like all those outside Germany
which were not transit camps only, should be divided into three
categories—which is in accordance with German instructions themselves
which fell into our hands. You will find these instructions
in your second document book, Page 11. The pages follow in
regular order. It is Document Number 1063-PS, USA-492. We read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German Police has
given his approval for the classification of the concentration
camps into various categories which take into account the
prisoner’s character and the degree of danger which he
represents to the State. Accordingly, the concentration camps
will be classified in the following categories:</p>
<hr class='tbk297'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Category 1: For all prisoners accused of minor delinquencies.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk298'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Category 1a: For aged prisoners and those able to work
under only certain conditions.</p>
<hr class='tbk299'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Category 2: For prisoners with more serious charges, but
still capable of re-education and improvement.</p>
<hr class='tbk300'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Category 3: For major offenders charged with particularly
serious crimes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 2 January 1941, the date of this document, the German
administration, in dividing the camps into three categories, made
an enumeration of the principal German camps throughout Germany
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
in each category. It seems unnecessary to me to revert to the
geographical location of these camps within Germany, since my
American colleagues, with the help of geographical maps, have
already dealt fully with this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organization and functioning of these camps had a double
purpose: The first, according to Document Number F-285, was to
make good the labor shortage, and obtain a maximum output at a
minimum cost. This document is submitted as Exhibit Number
RF-346. I shall not read it <span class='it'>in extenso</span>, but from Page 14 of your
second document book, I shall read the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For important military reasons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—this is dated 17 December
1942 and coincides with the difficulties encountered in the
course of the Russian campaign—“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because of great difficulties
of a military nature, which cannot be stated, the
Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German Police ordered on
14 December 1942 that, by end of January 1943 at the latest,
at least 35,000 internees, fit for work, shall be sent to concentration
camps.</p>
<hr class='tbk301'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To obtain this number the following is ordered:</p>
<hr class='tbk302'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As from this date and to 1 February 1943, all Eastern or foreign
workers who escaped or broke their contracts, and who do
not belong to allied, friendly or neutral states, shall be sent
back to concentration camps, by the quickest means possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Arbitrary internments with a view to procuring, at the least
possible cost, the maximum output from labor which had already
been deported to Germany but which had to be paid since it was
under labor contracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organization of these camps was further intended to
exterminate all unproductive forces which could no longer be
exploited by German industry, and which in general might hinder
Nazi expansion. Evidence for this is furnished by Document
Number R-91, Pages 20 and 21 of the second document book, submitted
as Exhibit Number RF-347, which is a telegram from the
Chief of Staff of the Reichsführer SS, received at 2:10 o’clock on
16 December 1942 from Berlin.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In connection with the increased allocation of labor to concentration
camps, ordered to be completed by 30 January
1943, the following procedure may be applied regarding the
Jews:</p>
<hr class='tbk303'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) Total number: 45,000 Jews.</p>
<hr class='tbk304'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) Start of transportation: 11 January 1943. End of transportation:
31 January 1943.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk305'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3)“—The most important part of the document—“The figure
of 45,000 Jews is to consist of 30,000 Jews from the district
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
of Bialystok; 10,000 Jews from the ghetto of Theresienstadt,
5,000 of which are capable of work and until now have
been used for light tasks in the ghetto; and 5,000 Jews generally
unfit for work, including those over 60 years of age. In order
to use this opportunity for reducing the number of inmates
now amounting to 48,000 which is too high for the ghetto, I
ask that special powers be given to me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the very end of this paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The number of 45,000 includes <span class='it'>those unfit for work</span>”—underlined
(italics)—“(old Jews and children included). By applying
suitable methods, the screening of newly-arrived Jews in
Auschwitz should yield at least <span class='it'>10,000 to 15,000 people fit for
work</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is underlined in the text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here is an official document which corroborates the
testimony of Mme. Vaillant-Couturier, among various other
testimonies on the same question, as to how the systematic selections
were made from each convoy arriving at Auschwitz, not by
the will of the chief of the camp of Auschwitz, but the result of
higher orders coming from the German Government itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it please the Tribunal, my report will cease here this evening,
and will be continued tomorrow, dealing with the utilization of
this manpower, which I shall endeavor to treat as quickly as possible
in the light of the testimonies we have already had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
Defendants Kaltenbrunner and Seyss-Inquart will be absent from
this morning’s session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, I understand that you do not wish
to cross-examine that French witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the French witness can go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, there is one reason that possibly
that French witness ought not to go. I think I saw she was moving
out of Court. Could you stop her, please? I am afraid that she
must stay for today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Dubost, are you going to deal with documents this morning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you be so good as to give us carefully
and slowly the number of the documents first, because we have a
good deal of difficulty in finding them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And specify, also, so far as you can, the
book in which they are to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: With the permission of the Tribunal, I shall continue
my description of the organization of the camps and the way in
which they functioned. We began last night by submitting to the
Tribunal Document Number R-91 which showed that their purpose
was: 1) to make good the shortage of labor; 2) to eliminate useless
forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Document R-91, which has been submitted under Exhibit
Number RF-347, we shall read Document Number F-285, already
submitted under Exhibit Number RF-346—second document book.
This document is dated 17 December 1942 and is the conclusion of
the document which we read to you yesterday. First paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For important military reasons, which cannot be stated,
the Reichsführer SS and the Chief of the German Police.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You read that yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is correct, Mr. President, Page 18, sixth
paragraph, at the top of the page.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Poles eligible for German citizenship and prisoners for whom
special requests have been made, will not be transferred
to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Last paragraph, Page 19:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Other papers will not be required for Eastern workers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This shows that arrests were made without discrimination in
order to obtain labor and that this labor was considered to be so
unimportant that it was sufficient to register it under serial
numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, we will show how this labor was utilized. Men were housed,
as the witness, Balachowsky, said yesterday, near factories in Dora
in underground shelters which they themselves had dug and where
they lived under conditions which violated all the rules of hygiene.
At Ohrdruf near Gotha, the prisoners constructed munition factories.
Buchenwald supplied the labor for the factories of Hollerith and
Dora and for the salt mines of Neustassfurt. The Tribunal will read
in Document Number RF-301, at the bottom of Page 45:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ravensbrück supplied the labor for the Siemens factories,
those of Czechoslovakia, and the workshops at Hanover.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These special measures, according to the witness, Balachowsky,
enabled the Germans to keep secret the manufacture of certain war
weapons, such as the V-1 and V-2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The deportees had no contact with the outside world. The
work of deportees enabled the Germans to obtain an output
which they could not have obtained even from foreign workmen.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The French Prosecution will now submit Document R-129 as
Exhibit Number RF-348, which the Tribunal will find in the second
document book. It deals with the management of concentration
camps:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The administration of a concentration camp, and of all
economic enterprises attached to it, rests with the camp
commandant.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Fifth paragraph, Figure IV:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The camp commandant alone is responsible for the work
carried out by the workmen. This <span class='it'>work</span>”—I underline (italics)
the word work—“this work must be, in the true sense of the
word, exhausting in order to obtain the maximum output.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Two paragraphs lower on the page:
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The hours of work are not limited. This duration depends
on the technical structure of the camp and the work to be
done and is determined by the camp commandant alone.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further on, the last paragraph, Page 23 of the book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He”—the camp commandant—“must combine a technical
knowledge of economic and military subjects with wise and
clever management of the men so as to reach a high potential
of output.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document is signed by Pohl. It is dated, Berlin, 30 April 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should just like to refer again to a document which we have
already quoted in relation to the camp of Ohrdruf, and which was
submitted under the Number RF-140.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will now read from Document 1584-PS, Exhibit Number RF-349.
This document is signed by Göring and is addressed to
Himmler. It definitely establishes the responsibility of Göring in
the criminal utilization of this deported labor. I shall read the
second paragraph of the second page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear Himmler:</p>
<hr class='tbk306'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at the same time I ask you to keep at my disposal for
Air Force armament the greatest possible number of KZ
prisoners.”—The initials “KZ” mean concentration camp.</p>
<hr class='tbk307'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Experience has so far shown that this labor can be put to
very good use. The situation of the war in the air necessitates
the transfer of this industry to underground workshops.
In such workshops, work and housing can be particularly
well combined for KZ prisoners.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We know then who was responsible for the frightful conditions
which the deportees of Dora had to endure. The person responsible
is in the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You did not give us the date of that, did
you? Is that 19 February 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: On the first page you will see that on 19 February
1944 a letter was addressed to Dr. Brandt, referring to teletypes
which were sent by the Field Marshal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it the second letter, the letter that you
read? Is the date of that 19.2.44?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is 15 April 1944 on the original, of which this
is a photostat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And could you tell us what KZ means, the
two letters, KZ?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: 15.4.44 on the original of the teletype, that means
concentration camp.
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, for the accuracy of the record,
it appears that the letter on the second page is not 15 April 1944,
but 14 February. Is that not so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes. It is 14 February, 2030 hours. It is a teletype,
which was booked 15 April 1944. That was the cause of my error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But, M. Dubost, were you submitting or
suggesting that this letter showed that the defendant, Göring, was
a party to the experiments which took place, or only to the fact
that these prisoners were used for work?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I was not referring to experiments. I was referring
to internment in underground camps, like the Dora Camp of which
the witness Balachowsky spoke yesterday in the first part of his
testimony. With regard to this will to exterminate, of which I have
been speaking from the beginning of my presentation this morning,
I think it is proved first of all by the text of Document Number
R-91, submitted under Exhibit Number RF-347, which I read
yesterday afternoon at the end of the session, a letter which has not
as yet been authenticated, and by statements made by the witnesses
who brought you proof that, at all the camps in which they
were, the same methods of extermination by work were carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the brutal extermination by gas is concerned, we have
the invoices for poison gas, intended for Oranienburg and Auschwitz,
which we submit to the Tribunal under Exhibit Number RF-350.
The Tribunal will find translations on Page 27 of the second
document book, Document Number 1553-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must point out, to be quite honest, that the French translation
of these invoices is not absolutely in agreement with the German
text. Therefore, in the fifth line, instead of “extermination” it
should be “purification.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The testimony of Mme. Vaillant-Couturier showed us that these
gases, used for the destruction of lice and other parasites, were
also used to destroy human beings. Besides, the quantity of gas
which was sent and the frequency with which it was sent, as you
can see from the great number of invoices which we offer in
evidence, prove that the gas was used for a double purpose. We
have invoices dated 14 February, 16 February, 8 March, 13 March,
20 March, 11 April, 27 April, 12 May, 26 May, and 31 May which
are all submitted as Exhibit Number RF-350.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you putting in evidence the originals of
these other bills to which you refer on this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I beg the clerk of the Court to hand them to Your
Honor, and I request the Tribunal to examine these invoices carefully.
They will observe that the quantities of toxic crystals sent
to Oranienburg and Auschwitz were considerable; from the invoice
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
of 30 April 1944 the Tribunal will see that 832 kilograms of crystals
were sent, giving a net weight of 555 kilograms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is this document that you have just
put in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The 30th of April 1944, but I am taking them at
random.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am not asking the date. What I want to
know is what is the authority for this document? It comes, does
it not, from one of the committees set up by the French Republic?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: No, Mr. President. The Document is an American
document which was in the American archives, under the Document
Number 1553-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, this note at the bottom of Document
1553-PS was not on the original put in by the United States,
was it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: No, Mr. President, but you have before you all
the originals under the number which the clerk of the Court has
just handed you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Unless you have an affidavit identifying
these originals, the originals do not prove themselves. You have got
to prove these documents which you have just handed up to us
either by a witness or by an affidavit. The documents are documents,
but they do not prove themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: These documents were found by the American
Army and filed in the archives of the Nuremberg Trial. I took
them from the archives of the American Delegation, and I consider
them to be as authentic as all the other documents which were
filed by my American colleagues in their archives. They were no
doubt captured by the American Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There are two points, M. Dubost. The first
is, that in the case of the original exhibit, 1553-PS, it was certified,
we imagine, by an officer of the United States. These documents
which you have now drawn our attention to are not so certified by
anyone as far as we have been able to see. Certainly we cannot
take judicial notice of these documents, which are private documents;
and therefore, unless they are read in Court, they cannot be
put in evidence. That can all be rectified very simply by such a
certificate or by an affidavit annexing these documents and showing
that they are analogous to the document which is the United
States exhibit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: They are all United States documents, and they
are all filed in the archives of the United States in the American
Delegation under the Number 1553-PS.
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The American Document Number 1553-PS
has not yet been submitted to the Tribunal and the Tribunal is of
the opinion that they cannot take judicial notice of this exhibit
without any further certification, and they think that some short
affidavit identifying the document must be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I will request my colleagues of the American
Prosecution to furnish this affidavit. I did not think it possible that
this document, which was classified in their archives, could be
ruled out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This purpose of extermination, moreover, does not need to be
proved by this document. It is sufficiently established by the
testimony which we have submitted to the Tribunal. The witness,
Boix, spoke these words: “No one is allowed to leave this camp
alive .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is only one exit, and that is the chimney of the
crematorium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Document F-321, Exhibit Number RF-331, Page 49, at the
top of the page, we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The only explanation which the SS men made to the
prisoners was that no captive should leave the place alive.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 179, the paragraph before the last of the French text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The SS told us there was only one exit—the chimney.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 174, the last paragraph before the heading “Gassing
and Cremation”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The essential purpose of this camp was the extermination
of the greatest possible number of men. It was known as the
extermination camp.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This destruction, this extermination of the internees, assumed
two different forms. One was progressive; the other was brutal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second document book which is before the Tribunal, we
find the report of a delegation of British Members of Parliament,
dated April 1945, submitted under Exhibit Number RF-351, from
which we quote these words (the third paragraph on Page 29):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Although the work of cleaning out the camp had gone on
busily for over a week before our visit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our immediate and
continuing impression was of intense general squalor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 30, the last paragraph but one:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We should conclude, however, by stating that it is our
considered and unanimous opinion, on the evidence available
to us, that a policy of steady starvation and inhuman
brutality was carried out at Buchenwald for a long period
of time; and that such camps as this mark the lowest point
of degradation to which humanity has yet descended.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Likewise, in the report of a committee set up by General
Eisenhower, Document L-159, which we submit under Exhibit
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
Number RF-352, Pages 31, 32, and 33 of the same document book,
we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The purpose of this camp was extermination.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 31:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Atrocities and other conditions in the concentration camps
in Germany. Report of a committee founded by General
Eisenhower under the auspices of the Chief of Staff, General
George Marshall, to the Congress of the United States, concerning
atrocities and other conditions in concentration camps
in Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 32:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The mission of this camp was extermination, by starvation,
beatings, torture, incredibly crowded sleeping conditions, and
sickness. The result of these measures was heightened by the
fact that prisoners were obliged to work in an armament
factory adjoining the camp which manufactured small firearms,
rifles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The means which were used to carry out this progressive
extermination are numerous, as shown in documents which have
just been handed to us. These documents, which we are going to
submit, have been communicated to the Defense. They consist of
printed formulas coming from Auschwitz, concerning the number
of blows which could be administered to the internees or prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These documents will be handed over to the Defense for their
criticism. They have just been given to us. I am not able to
authenticate their origin today. They appear to me to be of a
genuinely authentic character. Photostats of these documents have
been given to the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, the Tribunal thinks that they
cannot admit these documents at present. It may be that after you
have more time to examine the matter you may be able to offer
some evidence which authenticates the documents, but we cannot
admit the documents simply upon your statement that you believe
them to be genuine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Moreover, everything in the camps contributed
to pave the way for the progressive extermination of the people
who were interned there. Their situation was as follows: They
were exposed to a hard climate; some worked underground. Their
living conditions have been brought to light by the testimony which
you have heard. When the internees arrived, they were compelled
to remain naked for hours while they were being registered or
waiting to be tattooed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything combined to cause the rapid death of those who
were interned in the camps. A good number of them were subjected
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
to an even harder regime, the description of which was given to
the Tribunal by the American Prosecution when they submitted
Document Number USA-243 and the following, dealing with the
Nacht und Nebel regime, the NN.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think it is necessary to return to the description of this
regime. I shall merely submit a new document which shows the
rigor with which the NN regime was applied to our compatriots.
It appears under the Document Number F-278(b), submitted under
Exhibit Number RF-326. It comes from the German Armistice
Commission of Wiesbaden and shows that no steps were ever taken
in reply to repeated protests by the French population, and even
by the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government of Vichy, against the silence which
shrouded the internees of the NN camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now read Paragraph 2 which explains why no reply could
be given to families, who had good reason for anxiety:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This result was foreseen and desired by the Führer. His
opinion was that effective and lasting intimidation of the
population, which would put a stop to its criminal activities
against the occupation forces, would be achieved by the death
sentence, or by measures which would leave the offenders’
next of kin and the population generally in the dark as to
their fate.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We will not devote any more time to describing the blocks and
the hygienic conditions under which the internees in the blocks
lived. Four witnesses, who all came from different camps, have
pointed out to you that the hygienic conditions in these different
camps were identical and that the blocks were equally overcrowded
in all these camps. We know that in all cases the water
supply was insufficient and that deportees slept two or three in
beds 75 to 80 centimeters wide. We know that the bedding was
never renewed or was in very bad condition. We know likewise
the conditions in which the medical services of the camp functioned.
Several witnesses belonging to the medical profession have testified
to this fact before you. The Tribunal will find confirmation of their
testimony in Document F-121, Exhibit Number RF-354. We shall
read just one line of Page 100 of your document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Because of lack of water the prisoners were obliged to fetch
stagnant water from the water closets to satisfy their thirst.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then in Exhibit Number RF-331, (Document Number F-321),
Page 119 of the French text, third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The surgical work was done by a German who claimed to
be a surgeon from Berlin, but who was an ordinary criminal.
He killed the patient in each operation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Two paragraphs lower:
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The management of the block was in the hands of two
Germans, who acted as sick bay attendants—unscrupulous
men, who carried out surgical operations on the spot with
the help of a certain H .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., who was a mason by trade.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After the statements of our witnesses, who in their capacity as
doctors of medicine were able to care for patients in the camp
infirmaries, it seems superfluous to give further quotations from our
documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the workers had been worked to the point of exhaustion,
when it became impossible for them to recover, selections were
made setting apart those who were of no further use with a view
to exterminating them either in the gas chambers, as related by
our first witness, Mme. Vaillant-Couturier, or by intracardiac injections,
as related by two other French witnesses, Dr. Dupont and
Dr. Balachowsky. This system of selection was carried out in all
the camps and was, moreover, in response to general orders, proof
of which we showed when reading Document Number R-91, submitted
under Exhibit Number RF-347.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first document book the Tribunal will find the testimony
of Blaha, testimony which it will certainly recall and which was
received here the 9 January—it is the testimony of Blaha, 3249-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have already given this as evidence,
have you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am not going to read it. I merely wish to recall
it to the Tribunal because it forms part of my collection of proofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We do not want affidavits by witnesses who
have already given evidence. This affidavit, 3249-PS, has not been
put in, has it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: No, I am merely recalling the testimony which
was given at the session. We shall not submit this document, Mr.
President. We are merely utilizing this document to remind the
Tribunal that during the session Blaha pointed out conditions
existing in the infirmary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To all these wretched living conditions must be added work,
exhausting work, for all the deportees were intended to carry out
extremely hard work. We know that they worked in labor squads
and in factories. We know, according to the witnesses, that the
work lasted 12 hours a day at a minimum, and that it was often
prolonged to suit the whim of the camp commandant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document R-129 (Exhibit Number RF-348), from which I have
already read, emanating from Pohl and addressed to Himmler,
Pages 22 and 23 of the second document book, suggests that the
working hours should be practically unlimited.
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This work was carried out, as the witnesses have told us, in
water, in the mud, in underground factories—in Dora for instance—and
in the quarries in Mauthausen. In addition to the work, which
was exhausting in itself, the deportees were subject to ill-treatment
by the SS and the Kapos, such as blows or being bitten by dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Document Number F-274, Exhibit Number RF-301, Pages 74
and 75, brings official testimony to this effect. Is it necessary to
read to the Tribunal from this document, which is an official
document to which we constantly refer and which has been translated
into German and into English?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not think you need read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you, Mr. President. This same document,
Page 77 and Page 78, informs us that all the prisoners were forced
to do the work assigned to them, even under the worst conditions
of health and hygiene. There was no quarantine for them even in
case of contagious diseases or during epidemics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Document Number F-392, Exhibit Number RF-330,
which we have already submitted, which is the testimony of Dr.
Steinberg, confirms that of Mme. Vaillant-Couturier. It is the
twelfth document of your first document book. We shall read at
Page 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We received half a liter of herb tea; this was when we
were awakened. A supervisor, who was at the door, hastened
our washing by giving us blows with a cudgel. The lack of
hygiene led to an epidemic of typhus.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the third paragraph you will find the conditions
under which the prisoners were taken to the factories; in the fifth
paragraph a description of shoes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We had been provided with wooden shoes which in a few
days caused wounds. These wounds produced boils which
brought death to many.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now read Document R-129, Pages 22, 23, and 24 in the
second document book, and which we submit under the Number .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment; the Tribunal will adjourn now
for fifteen minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, the Tribunal has been considering
the question of the evidence which you have presented on the
concentration camps; and they are of opinion that you have proved
the case for the present, subject, of course, to any evidence which
may be produced on behalf of the defendants and, of course, subject
also to your right under Article 24-c of the Charter to bring in
rebutting evidence, should the Tribunal think it right to admit
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
such evidence. They think, therefore, that it is not in the interests
of the Trial, which the Charter directs should be an expeditious
one, that further evidence should be presented at this stage on the
question of concentration camps, unless there are any particular new
points about the concentration camps to which you have not yet
drawn our attention; and, if there are such points, we should like
you to particularize them before you present any further evidence
upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thank the Tribunal for this statement. I do not
conceal from the Tribunal that I shall need a few moments to select
the points which it seems necessary to stress. I did not expect this
decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the authorization of the Tribunal, I shall pass to the
examination of the situation of prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, possibly you could, during the
adjournment, consider whether there are any particular points, new
points, on concentration camps which you wish to draw our attention
to and present them after the adjournment, in the meantime proceeding
with some other matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The 1 o’clock recess?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, that is what I meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall, therefore, consider as established provisionally
the proof that Germany, in its internment camps and in its
concentration camps, pursued a policy tending towards the annihilation
and extermination of its enemies, while at the same time
creating a system of terror which it exploited to facilitate the
realization of its political aims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another aspect of this policy of terror and extermination appears
when one studies the war crimes committed by Germany on the
persons of prisoners of war. These crimes, as I shall prove to you,
had two motives, among others: To debase the captives as much as
possible in order to sap their energy; to demoralize them; to cause
them to lose faith in themselves and in the cause for which they
fought, and to despair of the future of their country. The second
motive was to cause the disappearance of those of them who, by
reasons of their previous history or indications given since their
capture, showed that they could not be adapted to the new order
the Nazis intended to set up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this aim, Germany multiplied the inhuman methods of
treatment intended to debase the men in her hands, men who were
soldiers and who had surrendered, trusting to the military honor of
the army to which they had surrendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transfer of prisoners was carried out under the most
inhumane conditions. The men were badly fed and were obliged to
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
make long marches on foot, exposed to every kind of punishment,
and struck down when they were tired and could no longer follow
the column. No shelter was provided at the halting places and no
food. Evidence of this is given in the report on the evacuation of
the column that left Sagan on 28 January 1945 at 12:30 p.m.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where shall we find it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is in the document book submitted by M. Herzog.
It is the report on the evacuation of the column that left Sagan on
28 January 1945. It is Document Number UK-78, submitted under
Exhibit Number RF-46. A column of 1,357 British soldiers, including
soldiers of all ranks, started out on 28 January 1945 for Spremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Possibly this is the first document in your
document book which has been handed up to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is right, Mr. President. I shall now read to
you the document on the evacuation of the Sagan Camp from
28 January to 4 February 1945. As the Tribunal has not the copy
before it, I pass to Document Number UK-170, Exhibit Number
RF-355.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am just telling you that I rather think this
may be the document, if it begins with “1,357 English prisoners of
war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Does it begin in that way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes. The document which you have before you,
Mr. President, deals with the transfer of British prisoners. The one
about which I wished to speak and from which I wanted to read to
you dealt with the transfer of French prisoners. I think that it is
not necessary for me to lengthen the session by showing the
Tribunal that the British and the French prisoners were treated in
the same fashion. I shall, therefore, restrict myself to your
document.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1,357 British war prisoners of all ranks marched out of
Stalag Luft III in columns on 28 January 1945, and were
thereafter marched for distances varying from 17 to 31 kilometers
a day to Spremberg, where they were entrained for
Luckenwalde. Food, water, medical supplies, and adequate
accommodation were more or less nonexistent throughout the
trip. At least three prisoners .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had to be left at Muskau.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the bottom of the page, three lines before the end:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 31st they covered the distance of 31 kilometers to
Muskau. It is small wonder that at this stage three men,
Lieutenants Kielly and Wise, and Sergeant Burton collapsed
and had to be left in the hospital at Muskau.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 2 at the end of the document:
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the march, apart from the Red Cross parcel already
referred to, the only rations issued to the men were one-half
loaf of bread and one issue of barley soup for each. The
supply of water is described as ‘haphazard’.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No fewer than
15 of them escaped during the march.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now a statement by M. Bondot:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The camp conditions of the Franco-Belgian column were
even more rigorous. The camps were organized in a manner
which was contrary to all the rules of hygiene. The prisoners
were crowded into a very narrow space. They had no heat or
water. There were 30 to 40 men to a room in Stalag III-C.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>M. Boudot’s statement is to be found in the report on prisoners
and deportees which was also handed to you the other day by M.
Herzog. I believe that the Tribunal has kept its documents of last
Thursday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have kept those documents, but if we had
them on the Bench before us you would not be able to see us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Similar statements are found in the Red Cross
reports. Berger, who was in charge of prisoner-of-war camps under
Himmler from 1 October 1944, admitted in the course of his examination
that the food supply of prisoners of war was entirely insufficient.
The Tribunal will find on Page 3 of the document book,
which is before it, an extract from Berger’s examination. Second
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I visited a camp south of Berlin, the name of which I cannot
remember at the moment. I shall perhaps remember later. At
that time it was obvious to me that the food conditions were
absolutely inadequate and a violent argument between
Himmler and myself arose. Himmler was violently opposed
to continuing the distribution of packages of the Red Cross
in the prisoner-of-war camps at the same rate as before. As
for me, I thought that in this case we should be faced with
serious problems regarding the men’s health.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We present Document Number 826-PS as Exhibit Number
RF-356. This document was issued by the Führer’s headquarters
and is a report on a visit to Norway and Denmark. It is on Page 7
of your document book, Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All the prisoners of war in Norway receive only sufficient
food to keep them alive without working. The felling of
timber, however, makes such physical demands on these
prisoners of war that, if the food remains the same, a considerable
decline in production must soon be expected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This note applies to the situation of the 82,000 prisoners of war
held captive in Norway, 30,000 of whom were employed on very
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
hard construction work which was being carried out by the Todt
organization. This is found in the first paragraph of Page 7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now present to the Tribunal a document, Number 820-PS,
Page 9 in the document book. It deals with the establishment of
prisoner-of-war camps in the regions exposed to aerial bombardment.
It was issued by headquarters. It is dated 18 August 1943. It was
sent by the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force to the Supreme
Command of the Wehrmacht. We submit it as Exhibit Number
RF-358, and we shall read to the Tribunal Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Commander-in-Chief, Air General Staff, proposes to
erect prisoner-of-war camps in the residential quarters of
cities, in order to obtain a certain protection thereby.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip a paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of the above reason, consideration should be given
to the immediate erection of such camps in a large number
of cities which appear to be endangered by air attacks. As
the discussions with the city of Frankfurt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have shown, the
towns will support and speed up the construction of the
camps by all available means.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“So far, there are in Germany about 8,000 prisoners of war
of the British and American Air Forces (without counting
those in hospitals). By evacuating the camps actually in existence,
which might be used to house bombed-out people, we
should immediately have at our disposal prisoners of war for
a fairly large number of such camps.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This refers to the camps set up in bombed areas and areas which
were particularly exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 10 the Tribunal will find a document issued by the
Führer’s headquarters, dated 3 September 1943, dealing with the
establishment of these new prisoner-of-war camps for British and
American airmen. We submit this document as Exhibit Number
RF-339 (Document Number 823-PS):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1) The Commander-in-Chief, Air General Staff, is planning
the erection of further camps for air force prisoners, as the
number of new prisoners is mounting to more than 1,000 a
month, and the space available at the moment is insufficient.
The Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe proposes to
establish these camps within residential quarters of cities,
which would constitute at the same time a protection for the
populations of the town and, in addition, to transfer all the
existing camps, containing about 8,000 British and American
Air Force prisoners, to larger towns threatened by enemy air
attack.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk308'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) The Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht, Chief of
War Prisoners, has approved this project in principle.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 12 of the document book which the Tribunal has before
it is a document, Number F-551, which we shall submit as Exhibit
Number RF-360. It deals with the sentencing of prisoners of war
in violation of Article 60 and the following articles of the Geneva
Convention. The Geneva Convention provides that the protecting
power shall be advised of judicial prosecutions that are made
against prisoners of war and will have the right to be represented
at the trial. The document which we submit as Exhibit Number
RF-360 shows that these provisions were violated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In practice, the application of Articles 60 and 66, particularly
Paragraph 2 of Article 66 of the Convention of 1929, concerning
the treatment of prisoners of war causes considerable
difficulties. For the application of severe penal jurisdiction,
it is intolerable that precisely for the most serious offenses,
as for instance, attacks on the guards, the death sentence
cannot be carried out until 3 months after its notification to
the protecting power. The discipline of prisoners of war is
bound to suffer from this.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass over the rest of the paragraph. On Page 12:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The following regulation is proposed:</p>
<hr class='tbk309'/>
<p class='noindent'>“a) The French may be confident that the trials by German
courts-martial will be carried out thoroughly and conscientiously
as before;</p>
<hr class='tbk310'/>
<p class='noindent'>“b) Germany will designate, as before, a defense counsel and
an interpreter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk311'/>
<p class='noindent'>“c) In case of a death sentence an adequate respite will be
granted.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On top of Page 13:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this respect, in urgent cases, however, Germany must
reserve for herself the right—even if not expressly stated—to
execute the sentence immediately.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“There is no question of allowing France, by virtue of Article
62, Paragraph III (POW), of the Geneva Convention, to
delegate representatives to the chief sessions of the German
Military Tribunals.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We possess an example of the violation of Articles 60 and those
following of the Geneva Convention in the report of the Netherlands
Government, which the Tribunal will find on Page 14 of its
document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we better break off now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
the Defendants Kaltenbrunner and Seyss-Inquart will be absent
from this afternoon’s session due to illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have an announcement to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the attention of the Tribunal was called by the Defendant
Hess to the absence of his counsel, the Tribunal directed that the
presentation of the individual case against Hess be postponed, so
that counsel could be present when it was presented. So far as the
cross-examination of witnesses who testified to matters affecting
the general case and not against Hess specifically is concerned, it
is the view of the Tribunal that the cross-examination conducted
by counsel representing the defendants equally interested with
Hess in this feature of the case was sufficient to protect his interests,
and the witnesses will therefore not be recalled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has received a letter from the Defendant Hess
dated 30 January 1946, to the effect that he is dissatisfied with the
services of counsel who has been appearing for him and does not
wish to be represented by him further, but wishes to represent
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal is of the opinion that, having elected, in conformity
with Article 16 of the Charter, to be represented by counsel, the
Defendant Hess ought not to be allowed at this stage of the Trial
to dispense with the services of counsel and defend himself. The
matter is of importance to the Tribunal, as well as to the defendant,
and the Tribunal is of the opinion that it is not in the interests
of the defendant that he should be unrepresented by counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has therefore appointed Dr. Stahmer to represent
the Defendant Hess, in place of Dr. Von Rohrscheidt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to M. Dubost</span>] Yes, M. Dubost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I beg the Tribunal to excuse me; I was completing
the work which they had requested me to do in relation to concentration
camps. In a few moments, when I have completed the
exposé on the question of prisoners of war, I shall present to the
Tribunal the end of the French presentation concerning concentration
camps. This will not be much, for we shall have only a few
documents to cite. Subject to counter evidence which the Defense
may bring, the systematic repetition of the same methods seems so
far sufficiently established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were at the point of reading a document of the Dutch
Government, which was already presented to the Tribunal under
Document Number F-224 (Exhibit Number RF-324) and which
establishes that a protest was formulated, following the secret
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
condemnation to death and the execution of three officers: Lieutenants
J. J. B. ten Bosch, B. M. C. Braat, and Thibo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think that the document to which I alluded this morning, which
is the official report of the French Government concerning prisoners,
is now in the hands of the Tribunal. It is the document submitted
by M. Herzog under Exhibit Number RF-46, Document
Number UK-78. I ask the Tribunal to excuse me, as I cannot present
this document again. I have no more copies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is evident from this document that the Nazis had a systematic
policy of intimidation. They strove to keep the greatest possible
number of prisoners of war in order to be able, if necessary, to
exercise efficacious pressure over the countries from which these
prisoners came. This policy was exercised by the irregular or
improper capture of prisoners, and also by the refusal, which was
systematically upheld, to repatriate the prisoners whose state of
health would have justified this measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the irregular or improper capture of prisoners of
war, we can cite the example of what happened in France after
the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the Ministry of Prisoners and Deportees, to which
we refer, indicates, on Page 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In 1940 certain French military formations laid down their
arms at the time of the armistice under the assurance given
by the German Army that troops who had thus surrendered
would not be taken into captivity. These troops were, nevertheless,
captured. The Alpine Army had passed over the
Rhône in order to be demobilized and was west of the region
of Vienne. They were taken prisoners and were sent to Germany
until the end of July 1940.</p>
<hr class='tbk312'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, noncombatant formations of special civilians were
led into captivity and imprisoned in accordance with Himmler’s
orders, which said that all Frenchmen of military age
were to be seized indiscriminately. In short, it was only
through the making of special exceptions and the private
initiative of unit commanders that all Frenchmen were not
transferred to Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk313'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Because of the enormous number of prisoners and the difficulties
that faced the German Army in taking all those men
to Germany, the German Army decided, in 1940, to create
what they called ‘Front-Stalags.’</p>
<hr class='tbk314'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The promise had been made to the Vichy Government, which
was established after the armistice, that soldiers who were
kept in these ‘Front-Stalags’ would be kept in France. Yet,
the men in these camps began to be sent to Germany in
October 1940.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In an additional report appended to the document book which is
before you, the Ministry of Prisoners and Deportees points out the
irregular capture of the troops of the fortified sector of Haguenau,
the 22d R.I.F., the 81st B.C.P., the 51st and 58th Infantry Regiments
and a North African division. It is Document F-668 which I
submit under Exhibit Number RF-361, the pages of which are not
numbered, it is appended to the document book. I quote the
document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Troops of the fortified sector of Haguenau: the 22d R.I.F.
and the 81st B.C.P.</p>
<hr class='tbk315'/>
<p class='noindent'>“These troops fought until 25 June, 1:30, and only stopped
firing after an agreement between the colonel in charge of
the fortified sector of Haguenau and the German generals, an
agreement which guaranteed the troops the honors of war
and particularly that they would not be made prisoners. The
51st and 58th Infantry Regiments, as well as a North African
Division, withdrew towards Toul only after an agreement,
signed on the 22 June, between the French General Dubuisson
and the German General Andreas, at Thuilleaux-Groseilles,
Meurthe-et-Moselle, an agreement guaranteeing military
honors and confirming that the troops would not be taken
prisoners.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What official document does this document
come from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: From the Ministry of Prisoners and Deportees. It
is the additional report which was made by the French Government.
We submit it under Exhibit Number RF-361.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got the report on the captivity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This report will be submitted to you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It appears to be Addition Number 2 to the
report on the captivity, for the attention of the French Delegation
to the Court of Justice at Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is correct, Mr. President. The information
which I have just read to the Tribunal consists of extracts from a
note from Darlan to Ambassador Scapini on 22 April 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But M. Dubost, is there anything to show
that it is an official document, such as this book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This document, Mr. President, bears no relation to
the one which I am quoting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, I know it does not, but this is an official
document produced by the Republic of France, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How do you show that this Addition Number
2 to the report on captivity is equally an official document with
this one? That is what we want to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, it is a report which was submitted
in the name of the Government of the French Republic by the delegation
which I have the honor to represent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you see, this one here is headed “Service
of Information of War Crimes, Official French Edition.” Now,
that seems to us to be different from this mere typewritten copy,
which has on it the “Appendix Number 2 to the Report on the
Captivity.” We do not know whose report on the captivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, you have before you the official
note of transmission from our government. The clerk of the Court
has just handed it to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have this document, which appears to be
an official document, but this addition has no such seal upon it as
this has.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: There is mention of an appendix to this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The other is marked: Appendix. It must be
identified by a seal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The covering letter has a seal and the fact that it
alludes to the document is sufficient, in my opinion, to authenticate
the document transmitted. May I continue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No. This document here has a letter attached
to it. This document here is not referred to in that letter specifically.
Therefore, there is nothing to connect the two documents
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I think there is a manuscript note in the margin.
I have not the document before me here and cannot be positive
about it but I think there is a manuscript note in the margin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal wishes you to put this in as one
document. I see there is a manuscript note here at the side, in
writing, which refers to the Appendix. If you will put the whole
thing in together .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is all submitted in one file.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I wish to read to the Tribunal extracts from two letters
addressed to the German Armistice Commission at Wiesbaden by
the ex-Ambassador Scapini, both dated 4 April 1941. The Tribunal
will find them reproduced in the document book before them, Pages
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22:
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“4 April 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk316'/>
<p class='noindent'>“M. Georges Scapini, Ambassador of France.</p>
<hr class='tbk317'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To his Excellency Monsieur Abetz, German Ambassador in
Paris.</p>
<hr class='tbk318'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Men captured after ‘the coming into force of the
Armistice Convention and treated as prisoners of war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>At the bottom of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I. The Geneva Convention applies only during a state of
war as far as captures are concerned. Armistice, however,
suspends war operations; therefore, any man captured after
the Armistice Convention came into force and treated as a
prisoner of war, is wrongfully retained in captivity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 17, third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Armistice Convention, in its second paragraph, states
only that the French Armed Forces stationed in regions to
be occupied by Germany are to be brought back quickly into
unoccupied territory and demobilized, but does not say that
they are to be taken into captivity, which would be contrary
to the Geneva Convention.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Fifth paragraph of the same page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Civilians. If it is admitted that civilians captured before
the armistice cannot be treated as prisoners of war, as discussed
in my previous letter, surely there is all the more
reason not to consider as such those captured after the armistice.
I note in this respect that captures, some of which
were collective, were carried out several months after the
end of hostilities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then on Page 18, the top of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“To the categories of civilians defined in my first letter, I wish
to add one more—that of demobilized civilians who were
going back to their homes in the occupied zone after the
armistice and who, more often than not, were captured on
their way home and sent into captivity as a result of the
initiative of local military authorities.</p>
<hr class='tbk319'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Soldiers. As such I would define, by convention, men who,
though freed after the armistice, could not for some reason—due
to the difficult circumstances of that period—be provided
with the regular demobilization papers. Many of them were
captured and taken into captivity under the same condition
as those mentioned above.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I think the Tribunal will not require the reading of that example,
but if the President wishes, I shall read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No.
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Let us turn to Page 19, the last paragraph, entitled:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A. Civilians not subject to military service.</p>
<hr class='tbk320'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is obvious that these men could not be considered soldiers
according to French law. They can be classified, according to
age, into three groups:</p>
<hr class='tbk321'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) Men under 21 not yet called to the colors. Example:
Flanquart, Alexandre, 18 years old, captured by the German
troops at Courrières, Pas-de-Calais, at the time of the arrival
of the latter in that region. His address in captivity was
Number 65/388, Stalag II-B.</p>
<hr class='tbk322'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(b) Men between 21 and 48 who were not mobilized, who
were demobilized, or who were considered unfit for service.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There follows a rather lengthy list which the Tribunal will perhaps
accept without my reading it. It consists merely of proper
names. In the middle of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(c) Men specially assigned to the army. I will classify them
into two groups:</p>
<hr class='tbk323'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Men mobilized into special corps, which are military formations
established at the time of the mobilization by different
ministerial departments, according to the following
chart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>At the top of Page 21:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. Men specially assigned, who at mobilization were kept in
the positions which they held in time of peace in military
services or establishments. Example: Workmen in artillery
depots.</p>
<hr class='tbk324'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Civilians specially assigned. Contrary to those mentioned
above, the civilians who were specially assigned did not
belong to military formations and were not subject to military
authority. Nevertheless they were arrested. Example:”—I
skip several lines—“Moisset, Henri, specially assigned to the
Marret-Bonin factory.”—I skip a few more lines.</p>
<hr class='tbk325'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Address in captivity: Number 102 Stalag II-A.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Those people were not all freed, far from it. Some remained prisoners
until the end of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall cite now a document submitted under Exhibit Number
RF-362 (Document Number F-224), the text of which is in your
document book, on Page 15a. This text may be summarized in a
few words. It is the story of Dutch officers who were freed after
the capitulation of the Dutch Army and recaptured shortly afterwards
and sent in captivity to Germany. Paragraph 3 of this
document:
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 9 May 1942 a summons addressed to all regular officers
of the former Dutch Army who were on active service on
10 May 1940 was published in the Dutch newspapers, according
to which they were to present themselves on Friday,
15 May 1942, at the Chassée Barracks in Breda .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“More than one thousand regular officers reported to the
Chassée Barracks on 15 May 1942. The doors were closed
after them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 7:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A German officer of high rank came into the barracks and
declared that the officers had not kept their word to undertake
no action against the Führer and, as a result of this,
they were to be kept in captivity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The following paragraph states that “they were taken from the
station at Breda to Nuremberg, in Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numerous obstacles were placed in the way of the release of
French prisoners of war who, for reasons of health, should have
been sent back to their families. I shall quote a document already
submitted under Exhibit Number RF-297 (Document Number F-417),
Page 23 of your document book; and I read, Paragraph 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The question of releasing French generals, prisoners of war
in German hands, for reasons of health or age was taken up
on several occasions by the French authorities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This reproduction of the stencil is not quite clear. I continue
with Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“So far as this question is concerned, the Führer has always
refused to consider either their release or allowing them to
be placed in hospitals in neutral countries.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today release or sending to hospitals is more out of the
question than ever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And a written note reads: “No reply to be given to the French
note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This note, in fact, was addressed by the Supreme Command of
the German Army to the German Armistice Commission, who had
asked for instructions as to whether or not they should reply to the
request concerning the release of French generals who were ill, a
request made by the Vichy Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much more serious measures were undertaken against our prisoners
of war by the German authorities when, for reasons of a
patriotic nature, some of our prisoners gave the Germans to understand
that they were not willing to collaborate with Germany. The
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
German authorities considered them as incapable of being assimilated
and dangerous; their courage and their determination gave
much concern to Germany, and the measures taken against them
amounted to nothing less than murder. We know of numerous
examples of murder of prisoners of war. The victims were mainly:
1) men who had taken part in commando actions; 2) airmen; 3) escaped
prisoners. These murders were carried out by means of
deportation and the internment of these prisoners in concentration
camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While interned in these camps, they were subjected to the regime
about which you know and which was bound to cause their death,
or else they were killed quite simply with a bullet in the back of
the neck, according to the KA method which has been described by
our American colleagues and on which I will not dwell. In other
cases they were lynched on the spot by the population, in accordance
with direct orders, or with the tacit consent of the German
Government. In yet other cases, they were handed over to the
Gestapo and the SD, who, as you will see at the end of my statement,
during the last years of the occupation had the right to carry
out executions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Tribunal’s permission, we shall study two cases of
extermination of combat troops captured after military operations:
that of commandos and that of airmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Tribunal knows, men who were commandos were almost
always volunteers. In any case, they were selected from among the
most courageous fighters and those who showed the greatest physical
aptitude for combat. We can consider them, therefore, as the
elite and the order to exterminate them as an attempt to annihilate
the elite and spread terror through the ranks of the Allied Armies.
From a legal point of view the execution of the commandos cannot
be justified. The Germans themselves, moreover, used commandos
quite extensively; but whereas, in the case of their own men being
taken prisoners, they always insisted that they be recognized as
belligerents, they denied that right to our men or to those of the
Allied Armies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main order concerning this was signed by Hitler on 18 October
1942, and it was extensively carried out. Moreover, this order
was preceded by other orders of the OKW, which show that the
question had been carefully studied by the General Staff before
becoming the subject of a final order by the head of the German
Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Document Number 553-PS, the Tribunal will find, on
Page 24 of the document book, an order signed by Keitel which we
submit as Exhibit Number RF-363. This order prescribes that all
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
isolated parachutists or small groups of parachutists carrying out
a mission shall be executed. It is dated 4 August 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do not read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thank the Tribunal for sparing me the reading
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 7 October 1942 a communiqué of the OKW, disseminated by
the press and radio, announced the decision taken by the High Command
to execute saboteurs. On Page 26 the Tribunal will find in
the document book extracts from the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> of 8 October
1942 (Document Number RF-364):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In future all terrorist and sabotage units of the British and
their accomplices, who do not behave as soldiers but as bandits,
will be treated as such by the German troops and shot
on the spot without mercy, wherever it may be.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Under the Exhibit Number RF-365 (Document 1263-PS), we
submit the minutes of a meeting of the General Staff of the Wehrmacht,
dated 14 October 1942. Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the era of total warfare sabotage has become one of
the most important elements in the conduct of war. It is
sufficient to state our attitude to this question. The enemy
will find evidence of it in the reports of our own propaganda
units.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 29, the end of Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Sabotage is an essential element .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we ourselves have
strongly developed this means of combat.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the sixth paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We have already announced by radio our intention of liquidating,
in future, all groups of terrorists and saboteurs acting
like bandits. Therefore the WFSt has only to issue regulations
to the troops how to deal with terrorist and sabotage
groups.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 30. The Tribunal will see what orders were given concerning
the treatment of what the German General Staff called
groups of terrorists and British saboteurs. It is certain that the
German General Staff never called their own commandos groups of
terrorists and saboteurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph A refers to groups of the British Army without uniform
or in German uniform. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In combat or in flight they are to be killed without mercy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph B:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Members of terrorist and sabotage groups of the British
Army wearing uniform, who in the opinion of our troops are
guilty of acting dishonorably or in any manner contrary to
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
the law of nations, are to be kept in separate custody after
capture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk326'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Instructions concerning the treatment to be inflicted upon
them will be given by the WFSt in agreement with the Army
legal service and the Counter-Intelligence Department, Foreign
Section (Amt Ausland Abwehr).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Page 31, Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Violation of the laws of war by terrorist or sabotage troops
is in the future always to be assumed when individual assailants
as saboteurs or agents, regardless of whether they were
soldiers or whatever their uniform might be, place themselves
outside the laws of war by committing surprise attacks
or brutalities which in the judgment of our troops “are inconsistent
with the fundamental rules of war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In such cases the assailants will be killed without mercy to
the last man, in combat or in flight.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Confinement in prisoner-of-war camps, even temporarily, is
forbidden.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus in carrying out these orders, if British soldiers, even in
uniform, were captured during a commando operation, the German
troops were to judge whether they had acted according to the laws
of war or not; and without any appeal, subordinates could annihilate
them to the last man, even when they were not engaged in
active fighting. These orders were applied to British commandos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now quote Document Number 498-PS, which was submitted
by our American colleagues under Exhibit Number USA-501
and which confirms the information which we have just given to
the Tribunal by the reading of the preceding documents. It seems
useless to read this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, there are two points to which I
wish to draw your attention. In the first place, it is said that you
are not offering these documents in evidence, you are simply reading
them, and they must be offered in evidence so that the document
itself may be put in evidence. You have not offered in evidence
any of these documents; you have just been reading from them or
have given them numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I have submitted them all—absolutely
all—except those which were already submitted by our colleagues;
and all were filed with a number, and can be handed to
you immediately. I shall ask the French secretary to hand them to
you with the exhibit numbers which I read out.
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: They have all been put in evidence already?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, some have been put in evidence and
I quoted them with their exhibit numbers; but those which have
not been submitted, I shall give French numbers when submitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are saying, “have been put in evidence
by some other member of the Prosecution”; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is correct, Mr. President. When I quote them
I give the number under which they were filed by my American
colleagues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That was filed by the American Prosecution,
was it not: 498?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: 498-PS on Page 32 has already been filed by my
American colleagues under the Number USA-501, as I said before,
sir. I shall not read it. I shall merely comment on it briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. With reference to the document
which preceded it on Pages 27, 29, 30, and 31 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall ask the French secretary to give them to
you with the numbers under which they were filed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have they been filed by the American prosecutor
too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Not all, Mr. President. Some were filed by the
American Prosecution, others were filed by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What the Tribunal wants you to do is, when
you put in a document, if it has not already been put in, give it a
number and announce the exhibit number so that the record may
be complete. Is that clear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is clear, Mr. President, but I believe that I have
done so from the beginning, since the French secretary has just
given you the file.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may have put numbers on the documents,
but you have not announced them in some cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another matter which I wish to state and it is this:
When I spoke before, what I asked you to do was to confine yourself
to any new points, and you are now giving us evidence about commandos
and about British commandos, all of which has been already
gone into in previous stages of the Trial, and that appears to us to
be unnecessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The Tribunal will pardon me, but I have not read
any of the documents already mentioned. The documents I read were
documents not cited before. I had just reached a document which
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
had been mentioned before, and I asked the Tribunal to excuse me
from even commenting on it, since I thought the document was
already well known to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have had a good deal of evidence
already about the treatment of commandos and sabotage groups,
evidence, if I remember right, which attempted to draw some
distinction between troops which were dropped from the air, for
instance, close up to the battle zone and troops that were dropped
at a distance behind the battle zone. You had quite a lot of evidence
upon that subject. If there is anything which is of special interest
to the case of France we would be most willing to hear it, but we
do not desire to hear cumulative evidence upon subjects which we
have already heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I did not think that I had brought cumulative
proof to the Tribunal in reading documents which had not previously
been read; but since that is so, I shall continue, but not
without emphasizing that, in our view, the responsibility of Keitel
is seriously involved by the orders which were given and by the
execution of these orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number 510-PS, Page 48, has not been read. We
submit it as Exhibit Number RF-367, and we ask the Tribunal to
take judicial notice of it. It concerns the carrying out of the orders
which were given concerning the landing of British detachments
at Patmos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum from the General Staff to the commander of
the different units, Document Number 532-PS, which is the
appendix to the Tribunal’s document book, repeats and specifies
the instructions which the Tribunal knows and does not bring
anything new to the case. We submit this document as Exhibit
Number RF-368, and we ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now deal with the execution of Allied airmen who
were captured. From the statement which was made on this
question, the Tribunal has learned that a certain number of air
operations were considered as criminal acts by the German Government,
which indirectly encouraged the lynching of the airmen by
the population or their immediate extermination by the action
“Sonderbehandlung” (special treatment); and need not be discussed
again. This was the subject of Document Number USA-333, which
has already been cited, and Document Number USA-334.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the scope of these instructions, orders were given by the
letter of 4 June 1944 to the Minister of Justice to forbid any prosecution
of German civilians in connection with the murder of Allied
airmen. This is the subject of Document Number 635-PS, which you
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
will find in the appendix to the document book. This document will
become Exhibit Number RF-370.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister and Head of the Reich Chancellery,
4 June 1944.</p>
<hr class='tbk327'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To the Reich Minister of Justice, Doctor Thierack.</p>
<hr class='tbk328'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Lynch law for Anglo-American murderers.</p>
<hr class='tbk329'/>
<p class='noindent'>“My dear Dr. Thierack:</p>
<hr class='tbk330'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the Party Chancellery has informed me of his
secret memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed, and has
asked me to make it known to you also. I am complying with
this, and ask you to consider to what extent you wish to
inform the tribunals and the public prosecutors.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 6 June, two important conferences were held between Kaltenbrunner,
Ribbentrop, Göring (all three defendants), Himmler,
Von Brauchitsch, officers of the Luftwaffe, and members of the SS.
They decided to draw up a definite list of air operations which
would be considered as acts of terrorism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original transcript, drawn up by Warlimont and bearing
written notes by Jodl and Keitel, is Document Number 735-PS,
which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-371. It was decided during
this conference that lynching would be the ideal punishment to stop
certain types of air operations directed against the civilian population.
Kaltenbrunner, for his part, promised the active collaboration
of the SD.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was it already read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This document, so far as I know, was never read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROFESSOR DOCTOR FRANZ EXNER (Counsel for Defendant
Jodl): I am protesting against the presentation of Document 532-PS,
dated 24 June 1944. That is a draft of an order which was presented
to Jodl but which was crossed out by him and therefore annulled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this opportunity I would also like to call the attention of the
Court to the fact that we, the Counsel for the Defense, did not
receive a document book like the one presented to the Tribunal;
and it is therefore very hard for us to check and to follow the
presentations of the Prosecution. Every morning we receive a pile of
documents, some of which partly refer to future and some to past
proceedings. But I have not seen a document book in chronological
order for weeks. Furthermore, it would be desirable for us to
receive the documents the day before. In that case, when testimony
is presented, we could be of assistance to both sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Exner, are you saying that you have not
received the document book or that you have not received the
dossier?
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: I did not receive the document book, I would like
to add something further. Some of the documents which have just
been presented were quoted without signatures and without date,
and it is questionable whether these so-called documents are to be
considered as documents at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I imagine that you have just heard—I
have told M. Dubost that he must announce the exhibit number
which the French Prosecutor is giving to any document which he
puts in evidence. As I understand it, he has been putting numbers
upon the documents; but in certain cases he has not announced the
number in open court. The document, as you have seen, has been
presented; and, as I understand, it has a number upon it, but he
has not in every case announced the number; and the Tribunal has
told M. Dubost that it wishes and it orders that every document
put in by the French Prosecutor should have an exhibit number
announced in Court. That meets the one point that you raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to your not having the document book, that is, of course, a
breach of the order which the Tribunal has made that a certain
number of copies of the documents should be deposited in the
defendants’ Information Center or otherwise furnished to defendants’
counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to Document 532-PS .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was a pause in the proceedings while the Judges conferred.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Exner, is there anything further you wish to say upon these
points, because we are just about to have a recess for a few
moments. We would like to hear what you have to say before we
have the recess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: I have nothing further to add to that; but if I may
be permitted to make a further remark, we were advised that it
was Your Honor’s wish that we should hear every day what is to
be the subject of the proceedings on the following day, which would,
of course, be a great help to our preparations. So far, that has
never been the case. I myself have never heard what was to be
dealt with the following day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. M. Dubost, the Tribunal would
like to hear what you have to say upon the points raised by
Dr. Exner. First of all, upon the Document 532-PS; secondly, why
he did not receive a document book; and lastly, why he has not
received any program as to what is to be gone into on the following
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: As to the question of program, as Dr. Exner
pointed out, the custom of providing it has not been established by
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
the Prosecution. No one has ever given it, neither the French
Prosecution nor its predecessors. Perhaps I did not attend the
session the day the Tribunal requested that the program should
be given. In any case I do not remember that the Prosecution was
ever requested to do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the document book is concerned, it is possible that
this book was not handed to the Defense in the form which is before
the Tribunal, that is to say, with the pages numbered in a certain
order. However, I am certain that yesterday I sent to the Defense
Counsel’s rooms the text in German and several texts in French of
all the documents which I was to submit today. I cannot assure
the Tribunal that they were handed over in the order in which
you have them before you, but I am sure that they were sent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As to Document 532-PS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I had not begun to read Document 532-PS, Mr.
President, so I could not have concealed the fact that there was a
handwritten note in the margin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it a document that had been put in
before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I do not believe so, Mr. President. In my dossier
there are a certain number of documents which I have not read,
as I knew it was the Tribunal’s wish that I should shorten my
presentation; and Document 532-PS, which I submitted under
Exhibit Number RF-368, is one of those.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The document, according to Dr. Exner, is a
draft of a decree which was presented to Jodl but was not granted
by him. Those were his words, as they came through on the translation;
and, therefore, he submits that it is not to be considered
and there is nothing to show that the document was ever anything
more than a draft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If so, isn’t it clear that it ought not to be received in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This is a question which the Tribunal will decide
after having heard the explanation of Dr. Exner. This document
did not seem to me of major importance to my presentation, since
I did not read from it. In any case, as I did not read it, I could
not have hidden from the Tribunal that there was a handwritten
note in the margin. It is certain that this handwritten note is an
element to be taken into consideration, and on which the Tribunal
will base its decision whether Exhibit Number RF-368 should be
accepted or rejected, after having heard the explanation of the
Defense.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, I had occasion during the recess to
talk to my client, Keitel. Before the recess, the French Prosecutor
had submitted as evidence Document Number F-668, Exhibit Number
RF-361, an extract from a note from Admiral Darlan, addressed
to the French Ambassador Scapini. The French Prosecutor believes,
as I presume from his words, that he has proved by this that the
agreements between German generals and French troops, who had
laid down their arms, had not been kept. In view of the gravity
of these accusations I would be obliged to the French Prosecution
if they would declare, with respect to this document, first, whether
these serious accusations of the French Government had also been
brought to the attention of the German Government? The French
Prosecutor had concluded from this document that the information
contained therein was also proved. I would like to point out that
it is an excerpt from a note from Admiral Darlan to the French
Ambassador, Scapini. It is not clear from this document whether
Ambassador Scapini had taken the necessary steps with the German
Government or, furthermore, what reply was made by the German
Government to this note. For this reason I would like to ask the
French Prosecutor to declare whether he can establish from the
documents he had whether these serious accusations were brought
to the attention of the German Government, and secondly, what
reply was made by the German Government. Since these documents
of the Armistice Commission are in possession of the victorious
powers, it is neither possible for the defendants nor the
Defense to produce evidence themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>M. Dubost approached the lectern.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Turning to M. Dubost.</span>] Perhaps the most
convenient course would be, if you wish to say anything about
the objection which Dr. Nelte has just made, for you to say it now.
As I understand it, that objection is that this document, F-668
(RF-361), is a note by Admiral Darlan complaining that certain
French troops were surrendered on the terms that they were not to
be made prisoners of war, but were afterwards sent to Germany
as prisoners of war. What Dr. Nelte says is, was that matter taken
up with the German Government and if so, what answer did the
German Government give? That seems to the Tribunal to be a
reasonable request for Dr. Nelte to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The reply was given, Mr. President, by Ambassador
Scapini’s letter addressed to Ambassador Abetz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: My attention is drawn to the fact that the
two documents to which you refer are dated 4 April. The document
to which Dr. Nelte refers is a subsequent document, namely, 22 April.
Therefore it does not appear, from documents which were anterior
to the document of 22 April, as to what happened afterwards.
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I, myself, am not aware of this.
These documents were forwarded to me by the Prisoners-of-War
Department. They are fragmentary archives forwarded by an official
French office, which I shall inform of the Tribunal’s wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps it should be investigated and found
out whether the matter was taken up with the German Government
and what answer the German Government gave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall do so, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Not at the moment, but in the course of
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall have to apply to the French Government
in order to discover whether in our archives there is any trace of
a communication from the French Government to the German
Government dated later than 26 April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In the event of your not being able to get
any satisfactory explanation, the Tribunal will take notice of
Dr. Nelte’s objection, or criticism rather, of the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is pointed out to me, too, the fact that the two earlier documents
to which you are referring are documents addressed by the
Ambassador of France to M. Abetz, the Ambassador of Germany;
and it may be, therefore, that there is a similar correspondence in
reference to Document Number F-668 (Exhibit Number RF-361)
here in the same file, which is the file of which the French Government
presumably has copies, or might have copies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is possible, but that is only a hypothesis which
I do not want to formulate before the Tribunal. I prefer to produce
the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I quite follow; you cannot deal with it for
the moment. As to the other matter which is raised by Dr. Exner,
the Tribunal considers that Document Number 532-PS, which has
been submitted under Exhibit Number RF-368, should be struck
out of the Record in so far as it is in the Record. If the United
States and the French Prosecutors wish the document to be put
in evidence at a future date, they may apply to do so. Similarly
the defendant’s counsel, Dr. Exner, for instance, if he wishes to
make any use of the document, of course he is at liberty to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reference to the other matters which Dr. Exner raised, it is
the wish of the Tribunal to assist defendants’ counsel in any way
possible in their work; and they are, therefore, most anxious that
the rules which they have laid down as to documents should be
strictly complied with, and they think that copies of the original
documents certainly should contain anything the original documents
themselves contain.
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This particular document, Number 532-PS, as a copy, I think
I am right in saying, does not contain the marginal note in the
script which the original contains. At any rate it is important that
copies should contain everything which is on the originals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is another matter to which I wish to refer. I have
already said that it is very important that documents, when they
are put in evidence, should not only be numbered as exhibits, but
that the exhibit number should be stated at the time; and also
even more important, or as important, that the certificate certifying
where the document comes from should also be produced for the
Tribunal. Every document put in by the United States bore upon
it a certificate stating where it had been found or what was its
origin, and it is important that that practice should be adopted in
every case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only other thing I want to say is that it would be very
convenient, both to defendants’ counsel and to the Tribunal too, that
they should be informed at least the night before of the program
which counsel proposes to adopt for the following day. It is true,
as was said, that perhaps that has not been absolutely regularly
carried out by the Prosecutor on all occasions; but it has been done
on quite a number of occasions within my recollection, and it is
at any rate the most convenient practice, which the Tribunal desires
should be carried out; and they would be glad to know above all
what you, M. Dubost, propose to address yourself to tomorrow; and
the Tribunal would be very grateful to know how long the French
Prosecutors anticipate their case will take. They would like you,
before you finish or at the conclusion of your address this afternoon,
to indicate to the Tribunal and to the defendants’ counsel,
what the program for tomorrow is to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Honor please, I wonder
if I could say one word in regard to the position as to documents,
because I had an opportunity during recess of consulting with my
friend Mr. Dodd, and also with my friend M. Dubost. All PS documents
form a series of captured documents, whose origin and the
process taken subsequent to the article, were verified on 22 November
by an affidavit by Major Coogan, which was put in by my
friend Colonel Storey. It is the submission of the Prosecution,
which, of course, it is delighted to elaborate any time convenient
to the Tribunal, that all such documents being captured and verified
in that way are admissible. I stress the word admissible, but the
weight which the Tribunal will attach to any respective documents
is, of course, a matter at which the Tribunal would arrive from
the contents of the document and the circumstances under which
it came into being. That, I fear, is the only reason I ventured to
intervene at the moment, that there might be some confusion
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
between the general verification of the document as a captured
document, which is done by Major Coogan’s affidavit, and the
individual certificate of translation, that is, of the correctness of
the translation of the different documents, which appeared at the
end of each individual American document. The fact is that my
friend, Mr. Dodd, and I were very anxious that that matter should
be before the Tribunal, and we should be only too delighted to
give to the Tribunal any further information which it desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does that affidavit of Major Coogan apply
to all the other series of documents put in by the United States?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: It applies to PS and I think
it is D, C, L, R and EC.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does that certificate then cover this particular
sheet of paper which is marked 532-PS, and has on it no other
identifying mark?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes. The affidavit proves that
that was a document captured from German sources; it gives the
whole process—what happens after. I have not troubled the Tribunal
by reading it, because as such we submit that it is admissible
as a submission. Of course, the matter of weight may vary. I do not
want the Tribunal to be under a misapprehension that every document
was certified individually; what is certified is, of course, a
non-captured document. If a document comes from any of the
sources mentioned in Article 21, then someone with authority from
his government certifies it as coming from one of these sources and
that we do individually. But concerning captured documents, we
do not make any individual certification; we depend on Major
Coogan’s affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but just a moment. Sir David, it is
perhaps right to say in reference to this particular document,
532-PS, or the portion of it which has been produced, first of all
that the copy which was put before us did not contain the marginal
note, and that it is, therefore, wrong. We are in agreement with
your submission that it has been certified, as you say, by Major
Coogan’s affidavit, which is admissible; but, of course, that has
nothing to do with its weight. That is the point on which
Dr. Exner was addressing us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So I appreciated it, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is a document—being a private document
and not a document of which we can take judicial notice—which
has not been read in court by the United States or other prosecutors,
and it is not in evidence now because it has not been read
by M. Dubost.
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Your Honor, with that, of course,
I do not desire anything further. That is the ruling of the Tribunal.
The only part that I did want to stress was that the PS as such is
being verified and, of course, subject to reading it in Court, it could
be put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. We quite understand that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ought to say, on behalf of the Tribunal, that we owe an apology
to the French Prosecutor and his staff, because it has just been
pointed out to me that this marginal note does appear upon the
translation and, therefore, M. Dubost, I tender to you my apology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thank you, Mr. President. The Tribunal will
certainly remember that this morning Document Number 1553-PS
was set aside, which includes in it bills for gas destined for Oranienburg
and Auschwitz. I believe that, after the explanation given by
Sir David, this Document 1553-PS may now be admitted by the
Tribunal since it has already been certified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was it read, M. Dubost?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes, Mr. President. I was in the process of reading
it this morning. It is the 27th document in the second document
book of this morning, but the Tribunal rejected it, with the demand
that I furnish an affidavit. The intervention of Sir David constitutes
this affidavit. I beg the Tribunal to forgive my making
this request, but I should be grateful if it would accept the document
which was refused this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, it was a question of gas, was
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: That is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There was one bill of lading and then there
were a number of other bills of lading which were referred to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Yes. And the whole constituted Document Number
1553-PS, submitted under Exhibit Number RF-350. This document
is included in the series covered by the affidavit of which Sir David
has spoken to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, if you attach importance to it,
would it not be possible for you to give us the figures from these
other bills of lading? I mean the amount of the gas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Certainly, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just in order that it may be upon the
shorthand note.
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: 14 February 1944, gross weight 832 kilos, net
weight 555 kilos (destination Auschwitz); 16 February 1944, gross
weight 832 kilos, net weight 555 kilos (destination Oranienburg);
13 March 1944, gross weight 896 kilos, net weight 598 kilos (destination
Auschwitz); 13 March 1944, gross weight 896 kilos, net weight
598 kilos (destination Oranienburg); 30 April 1944, gross weight
832 kilos, net weight 555 kilos (destination Auschwitz); 30 April
1944, gross weight 832 kilos, net weight 555 kilos (destination
Oranienburg); 18 May 1944, gross weight 832 kilos, net weight
555 kilos (destination Oranienburg); 31 May 1944, gross weight
832 kilos, net weight 555 kilos (destination Auschwitz). This appears
to me to be all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Document 1553-PS is added the statement by Gerstein, and
also the statement by the chief of the American service who
collected this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the permission of the Tribunal, I shall proceed with the
presentation of the crimes of which we accuse the defendants against
Allied prisoners of war who were interned in Germany. Document
Number 735-PS, Page 68 of the document book, which we submitted
a short time ago under Exhibit Number RF-371, is a report on
important meetings which brought together Kaltenbrunner, Ribbentrop,
and Göring, in the course of which the list of air operations
which constituted acts of terrorism was drawn up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was decided in these meetings that lynching would be the
ideal punishment for all actions directed against civilian populations,
which the German Government claimed had the character of
terrorism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 68 Ribbentrop is involved. We read in one of the
three copies of the notes of the meetings that were held that day,
in the first paragraph, 11th line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Contrary to the first proposals of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, who wanted to include all terrorist attacks against
the civilian population and consequently air attacks against
cities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The proposals made by Ribbentrop were far in excess of what was
accepted at the time of this meeting. The three lines which follow
deserve the attention of the Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Lynch law should be the rule. There was, on the other hand,
no question of a judgment rendered by a tribunal or handing
over to the police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Paragraph b), bottom of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one would have to distinguish between enemy airmen
who were suspected of criminal acts of this kind and prepare
for their admission in the airmen’s camp at Oberursel, and
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
those who should be turned over to the SD for special treatment
when the suspicions were confirmed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Tribunal will certainly remember the description which was
given of this “special treatment” by the American prosecution.
What is involved is purely and simply the extermination of Allied
airmen who had fallen into the hands of the German Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 69 the Tribunal may read, under Figure 3, the description
and the enumeration of the acts which are to be considered as
terrorist acts and as justifying lynching.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“(a) Firing weapons at the civilian population, and gatherings
of civilians.</p>
<hr class='tbk331'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(b) Firing at German airmen who have bailed out of their
aircraft.</p>
<hr class='tbk332'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(c) Firing weapons at passenger trains and public conveyances.</p>
<hr class='tbk333'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(d) Firing weapons at hospital or hospital trains that are
clearly marked with a red cross.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Three lines below:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Should such acts be established in the course of interrogation,
the prisoners must be handed over to the SD.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document originates from the Führer’s headquarters. It was
drawn up there on 6 June 1944, and it bears the stamp of the
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Wehrmacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think that has all been read, M. Dubost.
I think that document was all read before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I was told that it had not been read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have not verified it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We submit Document Number 729-PS, as Exhibit
Number RF-372. This document confirms the preceding one. It
originates from the Führer’s headquarters, is dated 15 June 1944,
and reiterates the orders I have read. But this document is signed
by General Keitel, whereas the preceding one was signed “J.” We
have not been able to identify the author of this initial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number 730-PS, which we next submit as Exhibit
Number RF-373, is likewise from the Führer’s headquarters, and is
also dated 15 June 1944. It is addressed to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs for the attention of Ambassador Ritter. The Tribunal will
find it on Page 71 in the document book. This document contains
the instructions signed “Keitel” in the preceding document, and it
is likewise signed by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall submit as Exhibit Number RF-374, Document 733-PS,
which concerns the treatment which is to be meted out to airmen
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
falling into the hands of the German Army. It is a telephone message
from the Adjutant of the Reich Marshal, Captain Breuer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I assume that you have finished with the question
of lynching. In the presentation of this case the words “Orders of
Keitel” have been used repeatedly. The prosecutor has not read
these documents. I would be obliged if the prosecutor would produce
a document which contains an order, which raises lynch law
to the level of an order, as has been claimed by the Prosecution.
The Defendants Keitel and Jodl maintain that such an order was
never given, that these conferences concerning which documents
have been produced—that these documents never became orders
because the authorities concerned prevented this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The documents speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Does the Tribunal wish to listen to the complete
reading of these documents which are signed by Keitel? They are
not orders, they are projects. Moreover, I emphasized that point
when I announced them to the Tribunal. At Page 80 of our document
book, you will find, dated 30 June 1944, with Keitel’s visa:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Note for meeting.</p>
<hr class='tbk334'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: The treatment of enemy terror flyers:</p>
<hr class='tbk335'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I. Enclosed, draft of written reply by the Reich Minister of
Foreign Affairs to the Chief of the OKW for the Operational
Staff of the Wehrmacht.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am skipping a paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“II. The Reich Marshal approves the definition of terror flyer
communicated by the OKW, as well as the procedure which
is proposed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document is submitted as Exhibit Number RF-375. I have
not submitted to the Tribunal a regular formal order; but I have
brought three documents which, in my opinion, are equivalent to a
formal order because, with the visa of Keitel, we have this note,
signed by Warlimont, which states: “The Reich Marshal approves
the definition of terror flyer communicated by the OKW, as well as
the procedure which is proposed.” This document bears the visa
of Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now submit a document, Number L-154, which has
already been submitted by our American colleagues under Exhibit
Number USA-335. My colleague has read this text <span class='it'>in extenso</span>. I
will merely refer to three lines, in order not to delay the proceedings,
“In principle, no fighter-bomber pilots brought down are to be
saved from the fury of the people.” That text comes from the offices
of Albert Hoffmann, Gauleiter and Commissioner for the Defense of
the Reich, of the Gau South Westphalia.
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Exhibit Number RF-376 we shall submit Document Number
F-686, on Page 82 of our document book. This is the record of
an interrogation of Hugo Grüner on 29 December 1945. He was
subordinate to Robert Wagner, Gauleiter of Baden and Alsace. In
the last lines of this document, Page 82, Grüner states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Wagner gave a formal order to kill all Allied airmen we
could capture. In this connection Gauleiter Wagner explained
to us that Allied airmen were causing great ravages on German
territory, that he considered it was an inhuman war, and
that therefore, under the circumstances, any airmen captured
should not be considered as prisoners of war and deserved no
mercy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 83, at the top of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He stated that Kreisleiter, if the occasion offered, should not
fail to capture and shoot the Allied airmen themselves. As
I have told you, Röhm was assistant to Wagner, but Wagner
himself did not speak. I can state that SS General Hoffmann,
who was SS chief of the police for the Southwest Region, was
present when the order was given to us by Wagner to kill
Allied airmen.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This witness, Hugo Grüner, confesses that he participated in the
execution of Allied airmen in October or November 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing through Rheinweiler, he (Grüner) noticed that some
English or American airmen had been taken out of the Rhine by
soldiers. The four airmen were wearing khaki uniforms, were
bareheaded, and were of average height. He could not speak to
them because he did not know the English language. The Wehrmacht
refused to take charge of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the third paragraph at the bottom of the page and the
witness declares—I am reading:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I told the gendarmes that I had received orders from Wagner
to execute any Allied airman taken prisoner. The gendarmes
replied that it was the only thing to be done. I then decided
to execute the four Allied prisoners and one of the gendarmes
present advised the banks of the Rhine as the place of execution.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 84, Paragraph 1, Grüner describes how he proceeded
to assassinate these airmen and admits that he killed them with
machine gun shots in the back. In the third paragraph he gives
the name of one of his accomplices, Erich Meissner, who was a
Gestapo agent from Lorrach, and then he denounces Meissner for
having himself killed an airman as he was getting out of his car
and was walking toward the Rhine. I read:
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“He killed them by firing a machine gun salvo at each of them
in the back, after which each airman was dragged by the feet
and thrown into the Rhine.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This affidavit was received by the Police Magistrate of Strasbourg.
The document which we shall submit was signed by the
magistrate’s clerk of the court as a certified copy. This is how the
orders given by the leaders of the German Government were carried
out by the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, I see that it is 5 o’clock now, and
perhaps you would be able to tell us what your program would be
for tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Tomorrow we shall complete the presentation of
the question of prisoners of war. We shall present to you in an
abridged form documents which seem to us to be indispensable, in
spite of the hearing of witnesses concerning the camps. There are
only a few documents, but they all directly inculpate one or other
of the defendants. Then we shall show how the orders given by the
leaders of the German Army led subordinates to commit acts of terrorism
and banditry in France against the innocent population, and
also against patriots who were not treated as francs-tireurs but as
ordinary criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We expect to finish tomorrow morning. In the afternoon, my
colleague, M. Faure, could begin the presentation of this last part
of the French charges concerning crimes against humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you not able to give us any estimate of
the length of the whole of the French Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I believe that three days will be sufficient for
M. Faure. The individual charges will be summarized in one-half
day by our colleague, M. Mounier, and that will be the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 31 January 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>FORTY-SEVENTH DAY</span><br/> Thursday, 31 January 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
the Defendants Kaltenbrunner and Seyss-Inquart will be absent
from this morning’s session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Before finishing, Gentlemen, I must read you a few
more documents concerning war prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, it will be Document Number L-166, which we present
as Exhibit Number RF-377, Page 65 in your document book. It
concerns a note which summarizes an interview with the Reich
Marshal, on 15 and 16 May 1944, on the subject of pursuit planes.
Page 8, Paragraph Number 20:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Marshal will propose to the Führer that American
and English crews who fire indiscriminately on towns, on
civilian trains in motion, or on soldiers dropping by parachute,
shall be shot immediately on the spot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of this document need not be emphasized. It
shows the guilt of the Defendant Göring in reprisals against Allied
airmen brought down in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now read Document R-117, which we submit as Exhibit
Number RF-378. Two Liberators, brought down on 21 June 1944 in
the District of Mecklenburg, came to earth with their crews intact,
15 men all told. All were shot on the pretext of attempting to
escape. The document was found in the files of the headquarters of
the 11th Luftgaukommando, and states that nine members of one
crew were handed over to the local police. In the next to the last
paragraph, third line, we read that they were made prisoners and
handed over to the police in Waren. Lieutenants Helton and Ludka
were handed over on 21 June 1944 by the protective police to SS
Untersturmführer Stempel, of the Security Police, and former Commissioner
of the Criminal Police, at Fürstenberg:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“These seven prisoners were shot <span class='it'>en route</span> while attempting
to escape.</p>
<hr class='tbk336'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Lieutenants Helton and Ludka were also shot on the same
day while attempting to escape.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding the second Liberator, at Page 91 we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Crash of a Liberator on 21 June 1944, at 11:30 a.m.

one, seriously wounded, brought to the garrison hospital at
Schwerin.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit as Exhibit Number RF-379, Document F-553,
which the Tribunal will find on Page 101 of the document book.
This document concerns the internment in concentration camps and
extermination camps of prisoners of war. Among the escaped prisoners
a discrimination was made. If they were privates and noncommissioned
officers who had agreed to work, they were generally
sent back to the camp and punished in conformity with Articles 47,
and following, of the Geneva Convention. If it was a question of
officers or noncommissioned officers—this is a comment I am making
on the document which I shall read to the Tribunal—if it was a
question of officers or noncommissioned officers who had refused to
work, they were handed over to the police and generally murdered
without trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can understand the aim of this discrimination. Those French
noncommissioned officers who, in spite of the pressure of the German
authorities, refused to work in the German war industry had
a very high conception of their patriotic duty. Their attempt to
escape, therefore, created against them a kind of presumption of
inadaptability to the Nazi order, and they had to be eliminated.
Extermination of these elite assumed a systematic character from
the beginning of 1944; and the responsibility of Keitel is unquestionably
involved in this extermination, which he approved if he did
not specifically order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document which the Tribunal has before it is a letter of
protest by General Bérard, head of the French Delegation to the
German Armistice Commission, addressed to the German General
Vogl, the president of the said commission. It deals specifically with
information reaching France concerning the extermination of escaped
prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First paragraph, fourth line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This note reveals the existence of a German organization,
independent of the Army, under whose authority escaped
prisoners would come.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This note was addressed on 29 April 1944 by the commandant of
Oflag X-C. I read from Page 102:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Captain Lussus”—declares General Bérard to the German
Armistice Commission—“of Oflag X-C, and Lieutenant Girot,
of the same Oflag, who had made an attempt to escape on
27 April 1944, were recaptured in the immediate vicinity by
the camp guard.</p>
<hr class='tbk337'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 23 June 1944 the French senior officer of Oflag X-C
received two funeral urns containing the ashes of these two
officers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>No particulars could be given to this French officer as to the
cause of the deaths of Captain Lussus and Lieutenant Girot. General
Bérard pointed out at the same time to the German Armistice Commission
that the note—which the Tribunal will find on Page 104—had
been communicated by the commandant of Oflag X-C to the
French senior officer at that Oflag:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“You will bring to the attention of your comrades the fact
that there exists, for the control of people moving about
unlawfully, a German organization whose field of action
extends over regions in a state of war from Poland to the
Spanish frontier. Each escaped prisoner who is recaptured
and found in possession of civilian clothes, false papers and
identification cards, and false photographs, falls under the
authority of this organization. What becomes of him then, I
cannot tell you. Warn your comrades that this matter is particularly
serious.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last two lines of this note assumed their full significance
when the urns containing the ashes of the two escaped French officers
were handed to the senior officer of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our Soviet colleagues of the Prosecution will present the conditions
under which the escapes of the officers from the Sagan Camp
were repressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was there any answer to this complaint?
What you have just been reading, as I understand it, is a complaint
made by the French general, Bérard, to the German head of the
Armistice Commission, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I do not know if there was an
answer. I know only that the archives in Vichy at the time of the
liberation were partly pillaged and partly destroyed through military
action. If there was an answer we would have had it in the
Vichy archives, for the documents we present now are the documents
from the German archives of the German Armistice Commission.
As to the French archives, I do not know what has become
of them. In any case it is possible they may have disappeared as
a result of military action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was about to inform the Tribunal that my Soviet colleagues
would set forth the conditions under which repressive measures
were carried out at the camp of Sagan for attempts to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit as Exhibit Number RF-380, Document Number F-672,
which the Tribunal will find on Page 115 of its document book. This
is a report from the Service for War Prisoners and Deportees, dated
9 January 1946, which relates to the deportation to Buchenwald of
20 French prisoners of war. This report must be considered as an
authentic document, as well as the reports of war prisoners which
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
are annexed thereto. On Page 116 is the report of Claude Petit,
former prisoners’ representative in Stalag VI-G.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In September 1943 the French civilian workers in Germany
and the French prisoners of war who had been converted”—that
means converted into workers—“were deprived of all
spiritual help, there being no priest among them. Lieutenant
Piard, head chaplain of Stalag VI-G, after having spoken with
the prisoners-of-war chaplain, Abbé Rodhain, decided to turn
into workers six prisoner-of-war priests who volunteered to
exercise their ministerial functions among the French civilians.</p>
<hr class='tbk338'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This change in classification of priests was difficult to accomplish,
as the Gestapo did not authorize the presence of chaplains
among civilian workers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These priests and a few scouts organized a scout group, and a
group of Catholic Action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 117:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the beginning of 1944 the priests felt themselves being
watched by the Gestapo in their various activities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk339'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the end of July 1944, the six priests were arrested almost
simultaneously and taken to the prison of Brauweiler, near
Cologne.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 118, the same happened to the scouts. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Against this flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention I
took numerous steps and made several protests; for the prisoners
of war arrested by the Gestapo I even asked the reason
for their arrest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk340'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Owing to the rapid advance of the allies, who were approaching
Aachen, all the prisoners of Brauweiler were taken
to Cologne.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Dr. Stahmer approached the lectern.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, before allowing the Defense Counsel
to interrupt, permit me to finish reading this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Thank you, Mr. President. With the end of this
paragraph the Tribunal learns that the German military authorities
themselves took steps in order to learn the fate of these prisoners:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The military authorities having no knowledge thereof, immediately
undertook correspondence with Buchenwald, correspondence
which remained without answer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And again:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the beginning of March, Major Bramkamp, chief of the
Abwehr group, had to go personally to Buchenwald.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>On Pages 120-121 the Tribunal will find the list of the prisoners
who thus disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 122 there is a confirmation of this testimony by M.
Souche, prisoners’ representative at Kommando 624, who writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. certain war prisoners, converted into workers, and French
civilian workers had organized in Cologne a Catholic Action
group under the direction of the re-classified war-prisoner
priests, Pannier and Cleton.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Page 123:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the arrests began with members of the Catholic Action”—and
the accusations were—“anti-German maneuvers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not know what Dr. Stahmer’s objection is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO STAHMER (Counsel for Defendant Göring): We are
not in a position to follow the exposé of the French Prosecutor.
First of all, the translation is not very good. Some sentences are
left out. Especially, wrong numbers are mentioned. For instance,
612 has been mentioned. I have it here. It is quite a different
document. We have not the document books and therefore we cannot
follow the page citations. Also my colleagues complain that
they are not in a position to follow the proceedings under this
manner of presentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: May I see your document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was handed to the President.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: This number was just mentioned, as can be
confirmed by the other gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The document which M. Dubost was reading
was 672. The Document you have got there is a different number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: But this was the number that came through to
us, 612, and not only I, but the other gentlemen heard the same
number. And not only this number, but all the numbers have been
given incorrectly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another difficulty is that we have not the document book. Page
118 had been referred to, but the number of the page does not
mean anything to us. We cannot follow at this rate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, I think the trouble really arises
from the fact that you give the numbers too fast and the numbers
are very often wrongly translated, not only into German, but sometimes
into English. It is very difficult for the interpreters to pick
up all these numbers. First of all, you are giving the number of
the document, then the number of the exhibit, then the page of the
document book—and that means that the interpreters have got to
translate many numbers spoken very quickly.
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is essential that the defendants should be able to follow the
document; and as I understand it, they have not got the document
books in the same shape we have. It is the only way we can follow.
But we have them now in this particular document book by
page, and therefore it is absolutely essential that you go slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, the document books, all the documents,
have been handed to the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you telling us that document books have
been handed to the Defense in the same shape they are handed to
us, let us say, with pages on them? Speaking for myself, that is
the only way I am able to follow the document. You mentioned
Page 115 and that does show me where the document is. If I have
not got that page, I should not be able to find the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, I announced at the same time RF-380,
which is the number of the exhibit. F-672 is the classification number.
All our documents bear a classification number. It was not possible
to hand to the Defense a document book paginated like the
one the Tribunal has, for it is not submitted in the same language.
It is submitted in German and the pages are not in the same place.
There is not an absolute identity of pagination between the German
document book and yours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am telling you the difficulties under which
the defendants’ counsel are working, and if we had simply a number
of documents without the pagination we should be under a
similar difficulty. And it is a very great difficulty. Therefore you
must go very slowly in giving the identification of the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I shall conform to the wishes of the Tribunal, Mr.
President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the document being read was
Document F-672.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: We cannot find Document 672. We have 673.
We have nothing but loose sheets, and we have to hunt through
them first to find the number. We have Number 673, but we have
not yet found Number 672 among our documents. It is very difficult
for us to follow a citation, because it takes us so much time to
find the numbers even if they have been mentioned correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I can understand the difficulty. Will you
continue, M. Dubost, and do as I say, going very slowly so as to
give the defendants’ counsel, as far as possible, the opportunity to
find the document. And I think that you ought to do something
satisfactory, if possible, to make it possible for them to find that
document—by pagination or some other letters. An index, for
instance, giving the order in which the documents are set out.
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Three days ago, two document books in French,
paginated like the books which the Tribunal has before it, were
handed to the Defense. We were able to hand only two to them,
for reasons of a technical nature. But at the same time we handed
to the Defense a sufficient number of documents in German to
enable each Defense Counsel to have his file in German. Does the
Tribunal ask me to collate the pages of the French document book
which we submit to the Defense with the pages of a document book
which we set up, when the Defense can do it and has the time to
do it? Three days ago the two French document books were handed
to the Defense. They had the possibility of comparing the French
texts with the German texts to make sure that our translations were
correct, and to prepare themselves for the sessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, M. Dubost. As I say, do it slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It is not correct that we received it 3 days ago.
We found this pile in our compartment yesterday evening. We
simply have not had time to number these pages. As I say, this
was in our compartment yesterday evening or this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let’s go on now, M. Dubost, and go slowly in
describing the identification of the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We shall pass to Document F-357, which will be
submitted as Exhibit Number RF-381. This document deals with
the carrying out of general orders concerning the execution of prisoners
of war. It contains the testimony of a German gendarme who
was made prisoner on 25 May 1945, and who declares (Page 127):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All prisoners of war, who had fallen into our hands in
whatever circumstances, were to be slain by us instead of
being handed over to the Wehrmacht as had been done
hitherto.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This concerned an order which was given in the middle of August
1944. The witness continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This execution was to be carried out in a deserted spot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On Page 128, the same witness gives the names of Germans who
had executed prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now submit Document 1634-PS, which will become
Exhibit Number RF-382. The Tribunal will find it on Page 129 in
their document book. It is a document which has not yet been
read. It relates to the murder of 129 American prisoners of war
which was perpetrated by the German Army in a field in the southwest,
and west of Baignes in Belgium, on 17 December 1944 during
the German offensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this report summarizes the facts. The American
prisoners were brought together near the crossroad. A few soldiers,
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
whose names are indicated, rushed across the field toward the west,
hid among the trees in the high grass, in thickets, and ditches, and
thus escaped the massacre of their companions. A few others who,
at the moment when this massacre began, were in the proximity of
a barn, were able to hide in it. They also are survivors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 129:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the artillery and machine gun fire on the column of
American vehicles continued for about 10 to 15 minutes, and
then two German tanks and some armored cars came down
the road from the direction of Weismes. Upon reaching the
intersection, these vehicles turned south on the road toward
St. Vith. The tanks directed machine gun fire into the ditch
along the side of the road in which the American soldiers
were crouching; and upon seeing this, the other American
soldiers dropped their weapons and raised their hands over
their heads. The surrendered American soldiers were then
made to march back to the crossroad, and as they passed by
some of the German vehicles on highway N-23, German
soldiers on these vehicles took from the American prisoners
of war such personal belongings as wrist watches, rings, and
gloves. The American soldiers were then assembled on the
St. Vith road in front of a house standing on the southwest
corner of the crossroad. Other German soldiers, in tanks and
armored cars, halted at the crossroad and also searched some
of the captured Americans and took valuables from them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Top of Page 131:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an American prisoner was questioned and taken with his
other comrades to the crossroads just referred to.</p>
<hr class='tbk341'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at about this same time a German light tank attempted
to maneuver itself into position on the road so that its cannon
would be directed at the group of American prisoners
gathered in the field approximately 20 to 25 yards from the
road.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I again skip four lines.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some of these tanks stopped when they came opposite the
field in which the unarmed American prisoners were standing
in a group, with their hands up or clasped behind their heads.
A German soldier, either an officer or a noncommissioned
officer, in one of these vehicles which had stopped, got up,
drew his revolver, took deliberate aim and fired into the
group of American prisoners. One of the American soldiers
fell. This was repeated a second time and another American
soldier in the group fell to the ground. At about the same
time, from two of the vehicles on the road, fire was opened
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
on the group of American prisoners in the field. All, or most,
of the American soldiers dropped to the ground and stayed
there while the firing continued, for 2 or 3 minutes. Most of
the soldiers in the field were hit by this machine gun fire.
The German vehicles then moved off toward the south and
were followed by more vehicles which also came from the
direction of Weismes. As these latter vehicles came opposite
the field in which the American soldiers were lying, they also
fired with small arms from the moving vehicles at the prostrate
bodies in the field.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 132:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some German soldiers, evidently from the group of those
who were on guard at the crossroad, then walked to the
group of the wounded American prisoners who were still
lying on the ground in the field .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and shot with pistol or
rifle, or clubbed with a rifle butt or other heavy object, any
of the American soldiers who still showed any sign of life. In
some instances, American prisoners were evidently shot at
close range, squarely between the eyes, in the temple, or the
back of the head.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This deed constitutes an act of pure terrorism, the shame of
which will remain on the German Army, for nothing justified this.
These prisoners were unarmed and had surrendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal authorized me yesterday to present the documents
on which the French accusation is based for establishing the guilt
of Göring, Keitel, Jodl, Bormann, Frank, Rosenberg, Streicher,
Schirach, Hess, Frick, the OKW, OKH, OKL, the Reich Cabinet, and
the Nazi Leadership Corps, as well as of the SS and the Gestapo,
for atrocities committed in the camps. I shall be very brief. I have
very few new documents to present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first concerns Kaltenbrunner. It is the American Document
L-35 which the Tribunal will find on Page 246 of the document book
concerning concentration camps, that is the second book. This
document has not been submitted. It is the testimony of Rudolf
Mildner, Doctor of Law, Colonel of the Police, who declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The internment orders were signed by the Chief of the Sipo
and SD, Dr. Kaltenbrunner, or, as deputy by the head of
Amt IV, SS Gruppenführer Müller.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In submitting this it becomes Exhibit Number RF-383 (bis).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning Göring we submit the American Document 343-PS,
Exhibit Number RF-384. This is a letter from Field Marshal Milch
to Wolff. This letter concludes with this phrase:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I express to the SS the special thanks of the Commander-in-Chief
of the Luftwaffe for the aid they have rendered.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Now, from what precedes, one can conclude that these thanks refer
to the biological experiments of Dr. Rascher. Thus, Göring is
involved in these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German SS Medical Corps is implicated. This one can gather
from Document 1635-PS, which has not yet been handed to the
Tribunal, which becomes Exhibit Number RF-385, and which the
Tribunal will find in the annex of the second document book. These
are extracts from reviews of microscopic and anatomical research.
They deal with experiments made on persons who died suddenly,
although in good health. The circumstances of their death are stated
by the experimenters in such a way that no reader can be in any
doubt as to the conditions under which they were put to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the permission of the Tribunal, I shall read a few brief
extracts. Page 132 of the document which we submit to the
Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The thyroid glands of 21 persons between 20 and 40 years
of age, who were in supposedly good health and who suddenly
died, were examined.</p>
<hr class='tbk342'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The persons in question, 19 men and 2 women, until their
death lived for several months under identical conditions, also
with regard to food. The last food taken consisted chiefly of
carbohydrates.</p>
<hr class='tbk343'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Replacement products and examination methods:”—that is
the title.</p>
<hr class='tbk344'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Over a considerable period, substance for experiments was
taken from the livers of 24 adults in good health, who suddenly
died between 5 and 6 o’clock in the morning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On examining these documents, as well as the originals, the Tribunal
will see that German medical literature is very rich in
experiments carried out on “adults in good health who died suddenly
between 5 and 6 o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one in Germany could be deceived as to the conditions under
which these deaths occurred, since the accounts of the SS doctors’
experiments in the camps were printed and published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the last documents is F-185(b), and (a), relative to an
experiment with poisoned bullets carried out on 11 August 1944,
in the presence of SS Sturmbannführer Dr. Ding and Dr. Widmann—Page
187 of the second document book concerning concentration
camps. These two documents are submitted as Exhibit
Numbers RF-386 and RF-387. The Tribunal will find the description
of this experiment, in which the victims are described as persons
sentenced to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The document has been read already, I think.
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is a document from the French archives. However,
Mr. President, I doubt whether the Tribunal has heard
Document F-185(b), Exhibit RF-386, which is the opinion of the
French professor, M. May, Fellow of Surgery, to whom the pseudo-scientific
documents to which I alluded just now were submitted—the
reports from scientific reviews of experiments. He wrote,
Page 222:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The wickedness and the stupidity of the experimenters
amazed us. The symptoms of aconitine nitrate poisoning have
been known from time immemorial. This poison is sometimes
employed by certain savage tribes to poison their war arrows.
But one has never heard of them writing observations in a
pretentious style, on the anticipated result of their experiments—observations
which are completely inadequate and
puerile—nor that they would have them signed by a ‘Doz,’
that is to say, a professor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit Document F-278(a) as Exhibit Number RF-388.
It involves Keitel. It is a letter signed: “By order of the High Command
of the Wehrmacht, Dr. Lehmann.” It is dated 17 February
1942 and is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it
implicates him. It concerns the regime in the internment camps:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Delinquents brought to Germany in application of the decree
of the Führer are to have no communication of any kind with
the outside world. They must, therefore, neither write themselves,
nor receive letters, packages, or visits. The letters,
packages, and visits are to be refused with the remark that
all communication with the outside world is forbidden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The High Command gives its point of view in a letter of
31 January 1942, according to which there can be no question of
Belgian lawyers being permitted for Belgian prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit Document 682-PS, which becomes Exhibit Number
RF-389, Page 134 of the second document book. This document
implicates the German Government and the Reich Cabinet. It is a
record of a conversation between Dr. Goebbels and Thierack, Minister
of Justice, in Berlin, on 14 September 1942, from 1300 hours
to 1415 hours.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“With regard to the destruction of asocial life, Dr. Goebbels
is of the opinion that the following should be exterminated:
All Jews and Gypsies, Poles having to serve 3-4 years of
penal servitude, and Czechs and Germans sentenced to death,
to penal servitude for life, or to security custody (Sicherungsverwahrung).
The idea of exterminating them by work is the
best.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We stress this last phrase which shows, even in the heart of the
German Government itself, the will to “exterminate by work.”
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The last document that we shall submit with regard to the concentration
camps is Document F-662, which becomes Exhibit Number
RF-390, Pages 77 and 78, second document book. This document
is the testimony of M. Poutiers, living in Paris, Place de Breteuil,
who points out that the internees in the detachments of Mauthausen-Ebens
worked under the direct control of civilians, the SS dealing
only with the guarding of the prisoners. This witness, who was in
numerous work units, states that all were ordered and controlled
by civilians and only supervised by the SS and that the inhabitants
of the country, as the internees went to and from their work and
while at work, could therefore observe their misery; which confirms
the testimony which has already been given before the Tribunal
during these last few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall summarize the increasing advance of the German
criminal policy in the West: At the beginning of the occupation,
violation of Article 50 of the Hague Convention; execution of
hostages, but creation of a pseudo “law of hostages” to legalize these
executions in the eyes of the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the years that follow, contempt for the rights of the human
individual increases, until it becomes complete in the last months
of the occupation. By that time arbitrary imprisonment, parodies of
trials, or executions without trial have become daily practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentences, the Tribunal will remember, were not put into
effect in cases of acquittal or pardon; people acquitted by German
tribunals, who should have been set at liberty, were deported and
died in concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time there developed and grew in strength the
organization of Frenchmen who remained on the soil of France and
refused to let their country die. At this stage German terrorism
was intensified against them ever increasingly. What follows is the
description of the terrorist repression carried out by the Germans
against the patriots of the west of Europe, against what was called
the “Resistance,” without giving this word any other meaning than
its generic sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the time Germany understood that her policy of collaboration
was doomed to defeat, that her policy of hostages only
exasperated the fury of the people whom she was trying to subdue;
instead of modifying her policy with regard to the citizens of the
occupied countries, she reinforced the terror which already reigned
there and tried to justify it by saying it was an anti-Communist
campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will recall Keitel’s order and will understand what
was thought of this pretext. All the French, all the citizens of
Europe without distinction, without any distinction of party, profession,
religion, or race, were involved in the resistance against
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
Germany and their heroes were mingled in the graves and in the
collective charnel houses into which the Germans threw them after
their extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this confusion was voluntary; it was calculated; it justified
to a certain degree the arbitrary measures of repression of which
we already had evidence in Document F-278, which we submit
under Number RF-391. It is dated 12 January 1943, and is signed
“Von Falkenhausen.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Persons who are found, without valid authorization, in
possession of explosives and military firearms, pistols of all
kinds, submachine guns, rifles, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, with ammunition,
are liable in future to be shot immediately without trial.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This order and others analogous to it continued to be executed
even after the allied landing in the west of Europe. These orders
were even carried out against organized forces in Belgium as well
as in France, although the Germans themselves considered these
forces as troops to a certain extent. This can be verified by reference
to Document F-673, submitted under Exhibit Number RF-392,
entitled “Terrorist action against patriots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps this would be a convenient time to
break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, M. Dubost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The document I have just submitted under Exhibit
Number RF-392 is a memorandum to the Wiesbaden Commission.
We read the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The action of the German troops, even if we admit the
truth of the facts presented by the French, is taking place in
the form of combat by far exceeding in scope any purely
police action against isolated outlaws. On the enemy side we
have organizations which absolutely refuse to accept the
sovereignty of the French Government of Vichy and which
from the point of view of numbers as well as of armament
and command should almost be designated as troops. It has
been reiterated that these revolutionary units consider themselves
as being a part of the forces fighting against Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk345'/>
<p class='noindent'>“General Eisenhower has described the terrorists who are
fighting in France as troops under his command. It is against
such troops”—on the original is written in red pencil
“unfortunately not only”—“that repressive measures are
directed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This document shows us that when in action the French Forces
of the Interior, as well as all French forces in the western occupied
countries, were considered as troops by the German Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see that it may be useful for the record. It
is in the document book on the extermination of innocent populations,
on Page 167.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I thank you, Mr. President. Are then these
patriots, who were consequently considered by the German Army
as constituting regular troops, treated as soldiers? No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The order of Falkenhausen is proof thereof. They were either
to be killed on the spot—and, after all, that is the fate of a combatant—or
else delivered to the Sipo, to the SD, and tortured to
death by these organisms, who dispensed with any legal formalities,
as is shown by Document 835-PS, which has already been submitted
under Number USA-527, and also by Document F-673, Page 6 in
your document book, which we submit under Exhibit Number
RF-392.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number F-673 is a considerable bundle of papers which
comes from the archives of the German Commission at Wiesbaden,
and we are submitting it in its entirety under Exhibit Number
RF-392. Whenever we refer to Document F-673, it will be one of
the documents in this big German book.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Letter from the Führer’s headquarters, 18 August 1944,
30 copies; copy 26; top secret.</p>
<hr class='tbk346'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Subject: Combatting terrorists and saboteurs in occupied
territories .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 2. Jurisdiction over non-German civilians in
occupied territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk347'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1) Enclosed herewith”—says the writer of this letter—“we
are transmitting a copy of the order of the Führer of 30 July
1944.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order of the Führer will be found on Page 9 of your
document book. Paragraph 3.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore order the troops and every individual member
of the Wehrmacht, the SS, and the police to shoot immediately
on the spot terrorists and saboteurs who are caught in the
act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk348'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2) Whoever is captured later is to be transferred to the
nearest local office of the Security Police and of the SD.</p>
<hr class='tbk349'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3) Sympathizers, particularly women, who do not take an
actual part in hostilities, are to be assigned to work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We know what that means. We know the regime of labor in
concentration camps. But I shall proceed with reading the text of
the covering letter of this order of the Führer, Paragraph 4. This
paragraph is a commentary on the order itself:
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Present legal proceedings relating to any act of terror or
sabotage or any other crime committed by non-German
civilians in the occupied territories, which endanger the
security or the readiness for battle of the occupying power,
are to be suspended. Indictments are to be withdrawn. The
carrying out of sentences is not to be imposed. The accused
and the records are to be turned over to the nearest local
office of the Security Police and SD.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This order, to be transmitted to all commanding officers, as
indicated on Page 7, is accompanied by one last comment, Page 8,
the penultimate paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Non-German civilians in the occupied territories who endanger
the security or readiness for battle of the occupying power in
a manner other than through acts of terrorism and sabotage
are to be turned over to the SD.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order is signed by Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this comment, Keitel has associated himself in spirit with the
order of his Führer. He has brought about the execution of numerous
individuals, for an order to kill without control any one suspected
of being a terrorist affects not only the terrorists but the innocent
and affects the innocent more than the terrorists. Moreover, Keitel’s
comment exceeds even Hitler’s own orders. Keitel applied Hitler’s
stipulation—on Page 9 of your document book—to a hypothetical
case which had not been foreseen, to wit:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Acts committed by non-German civilians in occupied territories
which endanger the security or readiness for battle, of
the occupying power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is on the general’s own initiative. It is a political act which
has nothing to do with the conduct of war. It is a political act
which compromises and involves him. It makes him participate in
the development and extension of the Hitlerian policy; for it is the
interpretation of an order from Hitler, within the spirit of the
order perhaps, but beyond its scope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instructions were given to the Sipo and the SD to execute without
judgment. These instructions were carried out. Document F-574
on Page 10 of your document book, submitted as Exhibit Number
RF-393, is the testimony of a certain Goldberg, an adjutant to the
Sicherheitspolizei in Chalon-sur-Saône before the liberation of that
city. He was captured by the patriots and interrogated by the
divisional commissioner, who was head of the regional judicial police
officials at Dijon. The Defense will certainly not accuse us of having
had him examined by a subordinate police officer. It was the chief
himself of the judicial police officials for the Dijon region who interrogated
this witness. The witness declared, Page 12:
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the end of May 1944, without my having seen any written
order on this subject, the Sicherheitspolizei of Chalon were
given the right to pronounce capital punishment and to have
the sentence executed without those concerned having
appeared before a tribunal and without the case having been
submitted for approval to the commander at Dijon. The
chief of the SD in Chalon, that is Krüger, had all necessary
authority to make such decisions. There was no opposition, so
far as I know, on the part of the SD of Dijon. I therefore
conclude that this procedure was regular and was the consequence
of instructions which were not officially communicated
to me but which emanated from higher authorities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Execution was carried out by members of the SD. Their names
are given by the witness, but they are not of particular interest to
this Tribunal, which is only concerned with the punishment of the
principal criminals—those who gave the orders and from whom the
orders emanated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How were these orders applied in the various countries of the
West? In Holland, according to the testimony found in the report
given by the Dutch Government, Page 15, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“About 3 days after the attempt against Rauter—about
10 March 1945—I witnessed the execution of several Dutch
patriots by the German ‘green’ police while I was working in
the fields in Waltrop.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This Dutch document is classified in the French file as Number
F-224 (Document F-224 (a), Exhibit RF-277) and has been submitted
to you in its entirety, but the specific passage to which I refer has
not been read. The witness continues, on Page 16 of your document
book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I spoke to an Oberwachtmeister of the ‘green’ police whose
name is unknown to me, and he told me that this execution
was in revenge for the attempt against Rauter. He told me
also that hundreds of Dutch ‘terrorists’ had been executed for
similar reasons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another witness stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“About 6 o’clock in the evening”—this is the German who
gave the orders to execute the Dutch patriots—“when I went
to my office, I received the order to have 40 prisoners shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 19, the investigators, who are Canadian officers, state
the conditions under which the corpses were discovered. I do not
believe that the Tribunal will want me to read this passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 21 the Tribunal will find the report of Munt, completing
and rectifying his report of 4 June on the execution of Dutchmen
after the attempt against Rauter.
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The execution was carried out on the order of Kolitz; 198
prisoners were transported. Munt denies having sanctioned the
execution of these Dutch patriots, but says that it was nevertheless
impossible for him to prevent it, in view of the orders from higher
sources which he had received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 22, next to the last paragraph, the same Munt states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After an attack against two members of the Wehrmacht on
two consecutive days, in which both were wounded and their
rifles taken away, my chief insisted that 15 Dutch citizens be
shot; 12 were shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An important document is to be found on Page 30 in your document
book. It is included in F-224, which comprises the documents
relative to inquiries made by the Dutch Government. This is a
decree concerning the proclamation of summary police justice for
the occupied Netherlands territory. It is signed by the Defendant
Seyss-Inquart. Therefore one has to go to him when seeking for the
chief responsibility for these summary executions of patriots in
Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this decree we take Paragraph 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I proclaim, for the occupied Netherlands territory in its
entirety, summary police justice which shall enter into force
immediately.</p>
<hr class='tbk350'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Simultaneously, I order that everyone abstain from any
kind of agitation which might disturb public order and the
security of public life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I skip a paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The senior SS and Police Leader will take every step deemed
necessary by him for the maintenance or restoration of public
order or the security of public life.</p>
<hr class='tbk351'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the execution of his task the senior SS and Police Leader
may deviate from the law in force.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Summary police justice! These words do not deceive us. This is
purely and simply a matter of murder, in that the police is
authorized in executing its functions to deviate from the law in
force. This sentence, which Seyss-Inquart signed and which
protected his subordinates who assassinated Dutch, patriots as far
as German law was concerned, is in itself the condemnation of
Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In execution of this decree the Tribunal will see that on 2 May—and
this is Page 32 of your document book—a summary police
tribunal pronounced the death sentence against ten Dutch patriots.
On Page 34, another summary police tribunal pronounced the death
sentence on ten other Dutch patriots. All of them were executed.
On the next page, still in application of the same decree, a summary
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
police court pronounced the death sentence on a patriot, and he
was executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document, Document F-224(a), Exhibit RF-277, comprises a
very long list of similar texts which seems to me superfluous to cite.
The Tribunal may refer to the last only, which is especially
interesting. We will consider it for a moment; it is on Page 46 of
your document book. This is the report of the Identification and
Investigation Service of the Netherlands, according to which, while
it was not possible to make known at that time the number of
Dutch citizens who were shot by the military units of the occupying
power, we can state now that a total of more than 4,000 of them
were executed. The details of the executions, with the places
where the corpses were discovered, follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This constitutes only a very fragmentary aspect of the sufferings
and the sacrifices in human life endured by Holland. That needs
to be stated because it is the consequence of the criminal orders of
the Defendant Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Belgium, the basic document is the French Document
F-685, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-394; and you will
find it on Page 48 of your document book. It is a report drawn
up by the Belgian War Crimes Commission, which deals only with
the crimes committed by the German troops at the time of the
liberation of Belgian territory, September 1944. These crimes were
all committed against Belgian patriots who were fighting against
the German Army. It is not merely a question of executions but
of ill-treatment and torture as well. Page 50:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Graide a camp of the secret army was attacked. 15 corpses
were discovered to have been frightfully mutilated. The
Germans had used bullets with sawn off tips. Some of the
bodies had been pierced with bayonets. Two of the prisoners
had been beaten with cudgels before being finished off with
a pistol shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoners were soldiers, taken with weapons in hand and
in battle, belonging to those units which officially, according to the
testimony in documents previously cited to you, were considered by
the German General Staff from that time on as being combatants.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Fôret, on 6 September, several hundred men of the
resistance were billeted in the Château de Forêt. The
Germans, having been warned of their going into action,
decided to carry out a repressive operation. A certain
number of unarmed members of the resistance tried to flee.
Some were killed; others succeeded in getting back to the
castle, not having been able to break through the cordon of
German troops; others were finally made prisoner.
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk352'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Germans advanced with the resistance prisoners in
front of them. After 2 hours the fighting stopped for lack of
ammunition. The Germans promised to spare the lives of
those who surrendered. Some of the prisoners were loaded
on a lorry; others, in spite of the promise given, were
massacred after having been tortured. The castle and the
corpses were sprinkled with gasoline and set on fire: 20 men
perished in this massacre; 15 others had been killed during
combat.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The examples are numerous. This testimony to heroic Belgium
was necessary. It was necessary that we should be reminded of
what we owe her, of what we owe to her combatants of the secret
army, and how great their sacrifice has been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to Luxembourg, we have a document from the
Ministry of Justice of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which is
Document Number UK-77, already submitted under Exhibit Number
RF-322, which the Tribunal will find on Page 53 of the document
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will note that a special summary tribunal, similar
to those which functioned in Holland, was set up in Luxembourg;
that it functioned in that country and pronounced a certain number
of death sentences, 21—all of them equally arbitrary, in view of
the arbitrary character of the tribunal which pronounced them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document contains the official indictment of the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg against all the members of the Reich Cabinet,
specifically against the Ministers of the Interior, of Justice, and the
Party Chancellery, and against the leaders of the SS and Police,
and especially against the Reich Commissioner for the Preservation
of German Nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Norway, Document UK-79 already submitted under
Exhibit Number RF-323, Page 55 of the document book, shows that
tribunals similar to the special tribunal set up in Holland by the
police were in operation in Norway. They were called the SS
tribunals. More than 150 Norwegians were condemned to death.
Besides, the Tribunal will remember the testimony of M. Cappelen,
who gave an account of what his country and his compatriots had
endured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding Denmark, on Page 57 of your document book, Document
Number F-666, already submitted as Exhibit Number RF-338,
the Tribunal will note that according to this official report of the
Danish Government police courts-martial similar to those which
functioned in Luxembourg, in Norway, and in Holland, functioned
against Danish patriots. These summary police tribunals, composed
of SS or police, in reality disguised the arbitrary measures of the
police and of the SS; measures not only tolerated, but willed by
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
the government, as can be shown by documents which we placed
before you at the beginning of this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We, therefore, can assert that the victims of those tribunals were
murdered without having been able to justify or defend themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of France the question should be carefully examined.
The Tribunal knows that from the moment of the landing,
answering the call of the General Staff, the French Secret Army
rose and began battle. Undoubtedly, in spite of the warning given
by the Allied General Staff, these combatants, who a few weeks
later were officially recognized by the German side as being
combatants, at the beginning found themselves in a rather irregular
situation. We do not contest that in many instances they were
<span class='it'>francs-tireurs</span>; we admit that they could be condemned to death;
but we protest because they were not condemned to death, but were
murdered after having been brutally tortured. We are going to
give you proof thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-577, which is submitted under Exhibit Number
RF-395, to be found on Page 62 of your document book, states that
on 17 August, the day before the liberation of Rodez, the Germans
shot 30 patriots with a submachine gun. Then, to finish them off,
they tore large stones from the wall of the trench in which they
were and hurled them on the bodies with some earth. The chests
and the skulls were crushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-580, Page 79 of your document book, which is
submitted to you as Exhibit Number RF-396, shows that five oblates
from the order of Marie—as far as I know these lay brothers were
not communists—were murdered after having been tortured, because
they belonged to a group of the Secret Army. In all, 36 corpses
were discovered after this execution, a “punitive measure” carried
out by the German Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 85 the Tribunal will read the result of the inquiry
and will see under what conditions these 5 monks were killed after
having been tortured and under what conditions the staff of a
resistance group, which had been betrayed, was arrested and
deported, together with a few members of the same religious order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidence is produced that men from the Maquis in the forest of
Achères were arrested and tortured after having been incarcerated
in the prison of Fontainebleau. We even know the name of the
German member of the Gestapo who tortured these patriots. His
name is unimportant—this German, Korf, carried out orders that
were given by Keitel and by the other defendants whose names
I mentioned just now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-584, submitted under Exhibit Number RF-397,
Pages 87 and 88, shows the Tribunal that when the bodies were
found it was discovered that 10 of them had been blindfolded
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
before being shot, that 8 had had their arms broken by injury or
torture, and many had wounds in the lower parts of their legs as
the result of being very tightly bound. That is the report of the
commissioner of the police at Pau, drawn up on 28 August 1944,
on the day following the liberation of Pau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit Document F-585 as Exhibit Number RF-398.
The Tribunal will find it on Page 96 of the document book. I will
give a summary:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day following the liberation, 38 corpses were found in two
graves near Signes in the mountain of Var. One of the leaders of
the Resistance of the Côte d’Azur, Valmy, and with him two
parachutists, Pageot and Manuel, were identified. Of this massacre
a witness was found—his name is Tuirot—whose statements are
copied on Pages 105, 106, and 107 of your document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tuirot was tortured, with his comrades, without having been
given the opportunity of help from a counsel or a chaplain. The
38 men were taken to the woods. They appeared before a parody
of a tribunal composed of SS. They were condemned to death and
the sentence was executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We place now before the Tribunal Document F-586 as Exhibit
Number RF-399. The Tribunal will find it on Page 110 of the
document book. It deals with the execution at Saint Nazaire and
Royans of 37 patriots, members of the French Secret Army, who
were tortured before being executed. Here is the statement of facts
by an eyewitness:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I came through the ruins and arrived at the Château of
Madame Laurent, a widow. There a frightful spectacle confronted
me. The castle, which the Gestapo had used as a
place of torture for the young Maquis, had been set on fire.
In a cellar there was the calcinated skeleton which prior to
death had had its forearms and a foot pulled off and which
had perhaps been burned while still alive.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But I proceed. Wherever the Gestapo was in operation there were
the same methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we place before the Tribunal Document F-699, which
relates to the murder at Grenoble of 48 members of the Secret
Army all of whom were tortured. This document is submitted as
Exhibit Number RF-400.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to Document F-587, which we submit as Exhibit
Number RF-401. The Tribunal will find this document on Page 115
of the document book. It concerns the execution by hanging of 12
patriots at Nîmes, 2 of whom were dragged from the hospital where
they were under care for wounds received in battle. These young
men had all been captured in combat at St. Hippolyte-du-Fort. The
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>
bodies of these wretched men had been defiled. On their chests
was a placard saying: “Thus are French terrorists punished.” When
the French authorities wished to perform funeral rites for these
unfortunate men, the bodies had disappeared. The German Army
had removed them. They have never been discovered. It is a fact
that two of these victims were dragged from the hospital. Document
F-587 contains particularly the report of a witness who saw the
men taken from the hospital ward where they were being cared for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now submit Document F-561 as Exhibit Number RF-402—Page
118 of your book. It deals with the execution at Lyons of 109
patriots who were shot under inhuman conditions. They were
killed at the end of a day’s toil. On 14 August Allied planes had
bombed the Bron airfield. From 16 to 22 August the German
authorities had employed requisitioned civilians and prisoners from
the Fort of Montluc at Lyons to fill the bomb craters. At the end
of the day, when the work was finished, the civilian laborers went
away; but the prisoners were shot on the spot after having been
more or less ill-treated. Their bodies were stacked in half-filled
craters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-591, which we submit as Exhibit Number RF-403,
Page 119 of the document book, is a report of atrocities committed
by the German Army on 30 August 1944 at Tavaux (Aisne):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the afternoon of that day soldiers of the Adolf Hitler
Division arrived at Tavaux. They appeared at the home of
M. Maujean, who was leader of the resistance. His wife
opened the door. Without explanation they shot at her,
wounding her in the thigh and also in the lower jaw. They
dragged her to the kitchen and broke one arm and one leg
in the presence of her children, aged 9, 8, 7, and 6 years, and
8 months. They poured inflammable liquid over Madame
Maujean and set fire to her in front of the children. The
elder son held his little sister, 8 months old, in his arms. Then
they told the children that they would shoot them if they did
not tell them where their father was. The children said
nothing, although they knew the whereabouts of their father.
Before leaving they took the children to the cellar and locked
them in. Then the Germans poured gasoline on the house and
set it on fire. The fire was put out and the children were saved.
These facts were told to M. Maujean by his eldest child.
No other person was a witness to these facts because the
inhabitants, frightened by the first houses set on fire, had
sought refuge either in trenches or in the neighboring fields
and woods.</p>
<hr class='tbk353'/>
<p class='noindent'>“During the same evening 21 persons were killed at Tavaux
and 83 houses were set on fire.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Next comes a report by the gendarme, Carlier, on the events of
the following day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-589, which we submit as Exhibit Number RF-404,
shows the number of murders of patriots committed in the region
of Lyons. It is dated 29 September 1944: 713 victims were found in
8 departments; 217 only have been identified. This figure is approximate;
it is definitely less than the number of people who are
missing in the 8 departments of Ain, Ardèche, Drôme, Isère, Loire,
Rhône, Savoie, and Haute Savoie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A German general, General Von Brodowski, confessed in his
diary, which fell into our hands, that he had caused the murder
of numerous patriots, and that the Wehrmacht, Police, and SS
operated together and were responsible for these murders. These
troops murdered wounded men in the hospital camps of the French
forces of the interior. This document, which is under Number
F-257, is submitted as Exhibit Number RF-405 and is to be found
on Page 123 of your document book. In the last four paragraphs
the police and the army combine:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have been charged with restoring the authority of the
Army of Occupation in the Department of Cantal and neighboring
regions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Dated 6 June 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“General Jesser had been charged with the tactical direction
of the undertaking. All troops available for the operation
will be subordinate to him, as well as all other forces.</p>
<hr class='tbk354'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Commander of the Sipo and of the SD, Hauptsturmführer
Geissler, remains at my immediate disposal; he will
submit to me proposals for a possible utilization”—and so forth.</p>
<hr class='tbk355'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The staff and two battalions of the SS Panzer Division ‘Das
Reich’ are, in addition, to remain available for the operation
in Cantal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>General Brodowski turned over to the SD (which is equivalent
to execution without trial) the French prisoners who were wounded
on 15 June 1944. The Prefect of Le Puy asked the liaison staff
whether the men wounded in the battle of Montmouchet and taken
into safety by the Red Cross of Puy could be delivered to Puy as
prisoners of war. This German general, executing the orders of
the German High Command—particularly of Keitel and Jodl—said
that those wounded men were to be treated as <span class='it'>francs-tireurs</span> and
to be delivered to the SD or to the Abwehr. Those wounded men
were turned over to the German Police and tortured and killed
without trial.
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the statement of Goldberg, which I have submitted,
any man turned over to the SD was executed. Events took place
on 21 June 1944 as indicated by Goldberg, “Twelve suspects were
arrested and turned over to the SD.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the date of 16 August 1944, Page 133, this general of the
German Army had 40 men murdered after the battles at Bourg-Lastic
and at Cosnat:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the course of operation Jesser, on 15 July 1944 in the
Bourg-Lastic region, 23 persons were executed. Martial law.
Attack on Cosnat; 3 kilometers east of St. Hilaire, during the
night of 17 July, 40 terrorists were shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 136, this German general admits in his own diary that
our comrades were fighting as soldiers and not as assassins. This
general of the German Army acknowledges that the French Forces
of the Interior took prisoners:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Southeast of d’Argenton, 30 kilometers southwest of Châteauroux,
the ‘Jako’ discovered a center of terrorists; 16 German
soldiers were liberated; arms and ammunition were captured;
7 terrorists were killed, 2 of them being captains. One German
soldier was seriously wounded.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another similar incident is also related further on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Discovery of two camps of terrorists in the region of
d’Argenton. Nine enemies were killed, two of whom were
officers; 16 German soldiers were liberated.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>At the bottom of the page he states, “We liberated two SS men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These French soldiers were entitled to the respect of their
adversaries. They conducted themselves as soldiers; they were
assassinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now until two o’clock.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
the Defendants Kaltenbrunner and Seyss-Inquart will be absent
from this afternoon’s session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: We had arrived, gentlemen, at the presentation of
the terrorist policy carried out by the German Army, Police, and
SS, indistinguishably united in their evil task against the French
patriots. Not only the militant patriots were to be the victims of
this terrorist policy. There were threats of reprisals against their
relatives, and these threats were carried into effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit Document 719-PS as Exhibit Number RF-406, which
you will find on Page 147 of the document book. It is the copy
of a teletype from the German Embassy in Paris to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in Berlin. The German Ambassador reports a
conversation which the Vichy unit had had with Laval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this message, who is probably Abetz, explains that
Bousquet, who was with Laval at the time of this conversation,
stated that he was completely ignorant of the recent flight of
Giraud’s brother:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Madame Giraud, three of her daughters, her mother, another
brother and the daughter-in-law of Giraud, were in Vals-les-Bains.
I replied that such measures were insufficient and that
he must not be surprised if the German police some day
reverted to sterner measures, in view of the obvious incompetence
of the French police in numerous cases.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The threat was put into execution. We have already stated that the
family of General Giraud were deported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit Document F-717 under Exhibit Number RF-407, Page
149 of your document book: “Paris, 1030 hours, 101, Official Government
Telegram, Paris, to the French Delegation of the IMT Nuremberg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this telegram it is evident that 17 persons, members of the
family of General Giraud, were deported to Germany. Madame
Granger, daughter of General Giraud, aged 32, was arrested without
cause in Tunis in April 1943, as well as her four children, aged 2 to
11 years, with their young nurse, and her brother-in-law, M. Granger.
The family of General Giraud was also arrested, on 9 October
1943. They were first deported to Berlin, then to Thuringia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I ask the forbearance of the Tribunal; the telegraphic style
does not lend itself to interpretation, “Sent first to Berlin and then
to Thuringia; women and children of M. Granger to Dachau.” (I
suppose that we must understand this to mean the wife of M. Granger
and the nurse who accompanied her.)
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, what is the document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: This is a French official telegram. You have the
original before you, Mr. President, “—101—Official State Telegram
Paris,” typed on the text of the telegram itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can we receive a telegram from anybody
addressed to the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, it is not addressed to the Tribunal;
it is addressed to the French Delegation. It is an official telegram
from the French Government in Paris, “Official State Paris,” and
it was transmitted as an official telegram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What does “IMT Paris” mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The International Military Tribunal in Paris. It is
our office in Paris at Place Vendôme—it is an office of the French
Ministry of Justice. The telegram begins, “General Giraud.” It is
a telegraphic declaration. The letters “OFF” at the beginning of the
telegram mean “Official.” Please forgive me for insisting that the
three letters “OFF” at the beginning of the telegram mean
“Government, official” from Paris. No French telegraph office could
transmit such a telegram if it did not come from an official
authority. This official authority is the French Delegation of the
IMT in Paris, which received the statement made by General Giraud
and transmitted it to us: “By General Giraud, French Delegation
of the IMT.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, the Tribunal will receive the document
under Article 21 of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am grateful to the Tribunal. I read further on,
at Page 150:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the other hand, the death of Madame Granger on 24 September
1943 is undoubtedly due to lack of care and medicine,
in spite of her reiterated requests for both. After an autopsy
of her body, which took place in the presence of a French
doctor, specially summoned from Paris after her death, authorization
was given to this doctor, Dr. Claque to bring the four
children back to France, and then to Spain, where they would
be handed over to their father. This was refused by the
Gestapo in Paris, and the children were sent back to Germany
as hostages, where their grandmother found them only
6 months later.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The last four lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The health of Madame Giraud, her daughter Marie Theresa,
and two of her grandchildren has been gravely impaired by
the physical, and particularly by the moral, hardships of their
deportation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As a reprisal for the escape of General Giraud, 17 persons were
arrested, all innocent of his escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have frequently shown that in their determination to impose
their reign of terror the Germans resorted to means which revolt
the conscience of decent people. Of these means one of the most
repugnant is the call for informers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-278(b), Page 152, which we submit as Exhibit Number
RF-408, is a reproduction of an ordinance of 20 December 1941,
which is so obviously contrary to international law that the Foreign
Ministry of the Reich itself took cognizance of it. The ordinance of
27 December 1941 prescribes the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whosoever may have knowledge that arms are in the possession
or keeping of an unauthorized person or persons is
obliged to declare that at the nearest police headquarters.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin, on 29 June 1942,
objected to the draft of a reply to the French note, which we do not
have here but which must have been a protest against this ordinance
of 27 December 1941. The Tribunal knows that in the military operations
which accompanied the liberation of our land many archives
disappeared, and therefore we cannot make known to the Tribunal
the protest to which the note of 29 June 1942, from the German
Foreign Ministry refers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 2 summarizes the arguments of the French protest.
The French evidently had written: If German territory were occupied
by the French, we would certainly consider as a man without
honor any German who denounced to the occupying power an
infraction of their laws, and this point of view was taken up and
adopted by the German Foreign Ministry. The note continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As a result of consideration of this matter, the Foreign Office
considers it questionable whether punishment should be
inflicted on whomsoever fails to denounce a person possessing
or known to possess arms. Such a prescription of penalty
under this general form is, in the opinion of the Foreign
Office, the more impracticable in that it would offer the
French the possibility of calling attention to the fact that the
German Army is demanding of them acts which would be
considered Criminal if committed by German citizens.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This German note, I repeat, comes from the Reich Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and is signed “Strack.” There is no more severe
condemnation of the German Army than that expressed by the
Reich Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself. The reply of the German
Army will be found by the Tribunal on Page 155, “Berlin. 8 December
1942. High Command of the Wehrmacht.” The High Command
of the Wehrmacht concludes:
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. since it does not seem desirable to enter into discussion
with the French Government on the questions of law evoked
by them, we too consider it appropriate not to reply to the
French note.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This note begins, moreover, by asserting that any relaxing of the
orders given would be considered as a sign of weakness in France
and in Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are not the signs of weakness that the German Army gave
in our occupied countries of the West. The weakness manifested
itself in terror; it brought terror to reign throughout our countries,
and that in order to permit the development of the policy of extermination
of the vanquished nations which, in the minds of all Nazi
leaders, remained the principal purpose, if not the sole purpose, of
this war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This terrorist policy, of which the Tribunal has just seen
examples in connection with the repression of attacks by our French
Forces of the Interior on the enemy, developed without any military
necessity for it in all the countries of the West. The devastations
committed by the enemy are extremely numerous. We shall
limit our presentation to the destruction of Rotterdam at a time
when the city had already capitulated and when only the question
of the form of capitulation had to be settled; and secondly, to a
description of the inundations which the German Army caused, without
any military necessity of any sort, in 1945 on the eve of its
destruction when that Army already knew that it had lost the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have chosen the example of Rotterdam because it is the first
act of terrorism of the German Army in the West. We have taken the
inundations because, without her dykes, without fresh water, Holland
ceases to exist. The day her dykes are destroyed, Holland disappears.
One sees here the fulfillment of the enemy’s aim of
destruction, formulated long ago by Germany as already shown by
the citation from Hitler with which I opened my speech, an aim
which was pursued to the very last minute of Germany’s existence
as is proved by those unnecessary inundations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit to the Tribunal Document F-719 as Exhibit Number
RF-409, which comprises Dutch reports on the bombing of Rotterdam
and the capitulation of the Dutch Army. On Pages 38 and 39
of the second document book are copies of the translations of
documents exchanged between the commander of the German
troops before Rotterdam and the colonel who was in command of
the Dutch troops defending the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Backer relates the incidents of that evening which
ended with the burning of the city. At 1030 hours a German
representative appeared with an ultimatum, unsigned and without
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
any indication of the sender, demanding that the Dutch capitulate
before 1230 hours. This document was returned by the Dutch
colonel, who asked to be told the name and the military rank of
the officer who had called upon him to surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 1215 hours Captain Backer appeared before the German lines
and was received by a German officer. At 1235 hours he had an
interview with German officers in a dairy shop. A German general
wrote his terms for capitulation on the letter of reply, which the
representative of the Dutch General Staff had just brought to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 1320 hours Captain Backer left the place, this dairy shop
where the negotiations had taken place, with the terms to which
a reply had to be given. Two German officers escorted him. These
escorting officers were protected by the flight of German aircraft,
and red rockets were fired by them at 1322 and 1325 hours. At
1330 hours the first bomb fell upon Rotterdam, which was to be
completely set on fire. The entry of the German troops was to take
place at 1850 hours, but it was put forward at 1820 hours. Later
the Germans said to Captain Backer that the purpose of the red
rockets was to prevent the bombing. However, there had been
excellent wireless communication from the ground to the aircraft.
Captain Backer expressed his surprise that this should have been
done by means of rockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work on the inundation of the “Wieringermeer” polder
began on 9 and 10 April 1945. I quote a Dutch document. That
day German soldiers appeared on the polder, gave orders, and
placed a guard for the dyke.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 17 April 1945 at 1215 hours the dyke was dynamited so
that two parts of it were destroyed up to a height somewhat
lower than the surface of the water of the Ijesselmeer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk356'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As for the population, they were warned during the night
of 16 to 17 April”—that is, at the time when the water was
about to flood the polder—“In Wieringerwerf the news
received by the mayor was passed from house to house that
at noon the dyke would be destroyed. Altogether for this
great polder, with an area of 20,000 hectares, not more than
8½ to 9 hours were granted for evacuation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Telephone
communications had been completely interrupted; and it was
impossible to use automobiles, which meant that some individuals
did not receive any warning until 8 o’clock in the
morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk357'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The time given to the population was, therefore, too short
for the evacuation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk358'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The looting in the flooded polder has already been mentioned.
During the morning of 17 April, on the day of the disaster,
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
groups of German soldiers begin to loot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These soldiers
came from Wieringen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Moreover, they broke everything
that they did not want to take .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This polder by itself covers half of all the flooded lands in
Northern Holland. The polder was flooded on 17 April, when defeat
was already a fact as far as the German Army was concerned.
The Dutch people are seeking to recover the land which they have
lost. Their courage, industry and energy arouse our admiration,
but it is an immense loss which the German Army inflicted upon
those people on 17 April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Terrorism and extermination are intimately interwoven in all
countries in the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document C-45, which we submit as Exhibit Number RF-410
and which is the first in the document book, is an order of
10 February 1944 showing that repression, in the minds of the
leaders of the German Army, was to be carried out without consideration
of any kind:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Fire must be immediately returned. If, as a result, innocent
people are struck, it is to be regretted but it is entirely the
fault of the terrorists.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These lines were written over the signature of an officer of
the general staff of the German Military Command in Belgium
and Northern France. This officer was never denounced by his
superiors as can be seen by the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-665, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-411, Page 2
of your document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The search of suspected villages requires experience. SD or
GFP (Secret Field Police) personnel should be called upon.
The real accomplices of the guerillas must be disclosed, and
apprehended with all severity. Collective measures against
the inhabitants of entire villages (this includes the burning
of villages) are to be taken only in exceptional cases and may
be ordered only by divisional commands or by chiefs of the
SS and Police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This document is dated 6 May 1944. It comes from the High
Command of the Wehrmacht; and it, or at least the covering letter,
is signed by Jodl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document involves not only the Army General Staff, but
the Labor Service—that is to say, Sauckel—and the Todt Organization—that
is to say, Speer. Indeed, in the next to the last paragraph
we may read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The directive .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is applicable to all branches of the Wehrmacht
and to all organizations which exercise their activities
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
in occupied territories (the Reich Labor Service, the Todt
Organization, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These orders, aimed at the extermination of innocent civilian
populations, were to be carried out vigorously but at the price of
a constant collusion of the German Army, the SS, the SD, and the
Sipo, which the people of all countries of the West place together
in the same horror and in the same reprobation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the war diary of General Von Brodowski submitted this
morning under Exhibit Number RF-405, an excerpt of which is to
be found on Pages 3, 4, and 5 of the document book, it is stated
that repressive operations were carried out:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“An action against terrorists was undertaken in the southwestern
area of the Department of Dordogne near Lalinde,
in which a company of Georgians of Field Police, and
members of the SD took part .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dated 14 June 1944 is a statement on the destruction of Oradour-sur-Glane.
I shall come back to the destruction of this village.
“600 persons are said to have been killed,” writes General Von
Brodowski. It is underscored in the text.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The whole male population of Oradour has been shot.
Women and children took refuge in the church. The church
caught fire. Explosives had been stored in the church. Even
women and children perished.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We shall let you know the results of the French inquiry. The
Tribunal will see to what degree General Von Brodowski lied when
he described the annihilation of Oradour in these terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning Tulle:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 8 July 1944 in the evening the barracks occupied by the
13th Company of the 95th Security Regiment were attacked
by terrorists. The struggle was terminated by the arrival of
the Panzer division, ‘Das Reich.’ 120 male inhabitants of
Tulle were hanged, and 1,000 sent to the SD at Limoges for
investigation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, could we see the original of this
document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I showed it to you this morning, Mr. President,
when I submitted it. It is rather a large document, if you will
remember, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. We would like to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ROBERT SERVATIUS (Counsel for Defendant Sauckel):
I should like briefly to rectify an error now, before it is carried
any further.
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Prosecutor mentioned that certain people were put
at the disposal of the Arbeitsdienst. I should like to point out that
Arbeitsdienst is not to be confused with the Arbeitseinsatz. The
Arbeitseinsatz was ultimately directed by Sauckel, whereas the
Arbeitsdienst had nothing whatsoever to do with Sauckel. I should
like to ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of that distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: On account of a technical incident, the Tribunal
will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The attorney for Sauckel, I think, was addressing
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: I had pointed out the difference between the
Arbeitsdienst and the Arbeitseinsatz. The French prosecuting
attorney apparently confused the Arbeitsdienst with the Arbeitseinsatz,
for he said that the Arbeitsdienst was connected with
Sauckel. That is not so. The Arbeitsdienst was an organization for
premilitary training which existed before the war and in which
young people had to render labor service. These young people
were to some extent used for military purposes. The Arbeitseinsatz
was concerned solely with the recruiting of labor to be
used in factories or other places of work. It follows, therefore, that
Sauckel cannot be associated with the accusations that were made
in this connection. That is what I wanted to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: The two German words were translated in an
identical manner in French. A verification having been made, the
remarks of the defense are correct and Sauckel is not involved,
but only the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Here are a few examples of terrorist extermination
in Holland, in Belgium, and in other occupied countries of the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland, as one example out of a thousand, there were the
massacres of Putten of 30 September 1944. They are included in
Document Number F-224, which we submit as Exhibit Number
RF-324 and which is to be found on Page 46 of the document book.
On 30 September 1944 an attack was made at Putten by members
of the Dutch resistance against a German automobile. The Germans
concluded that the village was a refuge for partisans. They searched
the houses and assembled the population in the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wounded German officer had been taken prisoner by the
Dutch resistance. The Germans declared that if this officer was
released within 24 hours no reprisals would be made. The officer
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
was released, after having received medical care from the soldiers
of the Dutch resistance who had captured him. However, in spite
of the pledge given, reprisals were made upon the village of Putten,
whose inhabitants were all innocent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now cite Paragraph 2 of the Dutch report:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The population gathered in the church was informed that
the men would be deported and the women had to leave the
village because it would be destroyed.</p>
<hr class='tbk359'/>
<p class='noindent'>“150 houses were burned down (the total amount of houses
in the built-up area being about 2,000).</p>
<hr class='tbk360'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Eight people, amongst whom a woman who tried to escape,
were shot.</p>
<hr class='tbk361'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The men were taken to the concentration camp at Amersfoort.
Amongst them were many accidental passers-by who
had been admitted into the closed village but who had been
prevented from leaving the place.</p>
<hr class='tbk362'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At Amersfoort about 50 people were selected; and during
the transport, 12 jumped out of the train. 622 men were
eventually deported to Auschwitz. The majority of those
died after two months.</p>
<hr class='tbk363'/>
<p class='noindent'>“From the 622 deported men, only 32 inhabitants of the
village of Putten and 10 outsiders returned after the liberation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium, we will cite only a few facts which are related in
Document Number F-685, already submitted under Exhibit Number
RF-394. This document is to be found on Page 48 in your document
book. It describes the murder of a young man who had sought
refuge in a dug-out. He was killed by the Germans who were
looking for soldiers of the Belgian secret army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Hervé the Germans fired on a lorry filled with young men
and killed two of them. The same day some civilians were killed
by a tank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 49, the summary executions of members of the secret
army are described. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Anhée, shots having been fired upon them, the Germans
crossed the river Meuse. They set fire to 58 houses and killed
13 men. At Annevoie, on the 4th, the Germans came across
the river and burned 58 houses.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then follows a report on destruction, useless from the military
point of view:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At Arendonck, on the 3rd, 80 men were killed, five houses
were burned. At St. Hubert, on the 6th, three men killed and
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>
four houses burned. At Hody, on the 6th, systematic destruction
of the village, 40 houses destroyed, 16 people killed. At
Marcourt, 10 people were shot, 35 houses were burned. At
Neroeteren, on the 9th, 9 people were killed. At Oost-Ham,
on the 10th, 5 persons were killed. At Balen-Neet, on the 11th,
10 persons were shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 50 contains the description of German extortions at the
time of the temporary stabilization of the front.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Hechtel, the Germans having withdrawn before the British
vanguard, the inhabitants hung out flags. But fresh German
troops came to drive out the British vanguard and reprisals
were taken; 31 people were shot; 80 houses were burned,
and general looting took place. At Helchteren 34 houses
were set on fire and 10 people were killed under similar
circumstances. The same thing took place at Herenthout .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk364'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The circumstances in which these men were executed are
always identical. The Germans search the cellars, bring the
men out, line them along the highway, and shoot them, after
having given them the order to run. In the meantime,
grenades are thrown into the cellars, wounding women and
children.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another example:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Lommel, the unexpected return of the German soldiers
found the village with flags out. Seventeen persons who had
sought refuge in a shelter were noticed by a German. He
motioned to a tank which ran against the shelter crushing it
and killing 12 people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Norway we shall take an example from a document
already submitted under Exhibit Number RF-323, Pages 51 and 52
of your book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on 13 April 1940, two women 30 years of age were shot
at Ringerike. On 15 April, four civilians, of whom two were
boys of 15 and 16 years of age, were shot in Aadal. One of
those murdered was shot through the head, and had also been
bayonetted in the stomach. On 19 April four civilians, of
whom two were women and one a little boy 3 years of age,
were shot at Ringsaker.</p>
<hr class='tbk365'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To avenge the death of the two German policemen, who
were shot on the 26th of April 1942 at Televaag, the entire
place was laid waste. More than 90 properties with 334
buildings were totally destroyed, causing damage to buildings
and chattels (furniture and fishing outfits) amounting to a
total of 4,200,000 Kroner.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In this document the Tribunal will find the continuation of the
descriptions of German atrocities committed in Norway, without
any necessity of a military character, simply to maintain the reign
of terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France massacres and destructions without military purpose
were extremely numerous, and all of them were closely associated.
We submit Document F-243 as Exhibit Number RF-412. The Tribunal
will find this document on Pages 178 to 193 of the document
book. It is a long list, drawn up by the French Office for Inquiry
into War Crimes, of the towns that were destroyed and looted
without any military necessity. The Tribunal will undoubtedly be
enlightened by the reading of this document. We shall give but a
few examples. In submitting this Document F-909 as Exhibit
Number RF-413, we intend to relate the conditions under which a
whole section of Marseilles was destroyed—Pages 56, 57, and 58, of
your document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is estimated that about 20,000 people were evacuated. This
evacuation was ordered on 23 January. It was carried out without
warning during the night of the 23rd to the 24th. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is estimated that 20,000 persons were evacuated. From
Fréjus some of them were shipped by the Germans to the
concentration camp of Compiègne.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk366'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The demolition operations began on 1 February at about
9 o’clock in the morning. They were carried out by troops
of the German engineer corps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk367'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The area destroyed is equivalent to 14 hectares: that is
approximately 1,200 buildings.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Inquiry was made to find those who were responsible for this
destruction. After the liberation of Marseilles the German consul
in Marseilles, Von Spiegel, was interrogated. His testimony is in
Document F-908, which we submit as Exhibit Number RF-414,
Page 53 of your document book. Spiegel stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I know that a very short time after the evacuation of the
old port the rumor spread that this measure had been brought
about by financial interests, but I can assure you that in my
opinion such a hypothesis is erroneous. The order came from
the higher authorities of the Reich Government and had only
two motives—the security of troops and the danger of epidemics.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We do not intend to give you a complete description of the
attacks committed by the Germans but merely a few examples.
We submit Document F-600 as Exhibit Number RF-415, Page 59:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At Ohis (Aisne) a civilian wanted to give an American soldier
some cider to drink. The Germans returned. The American
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
soldier was taken prisoner, and M. Hennebert was also taken
away by the Germans to a spot known as the ‘Black Mountain’
in the village of Origny en Thiérache where his body
was later discovered partly hidden under a stack of wood.
The body bore the trace of two bayonet wounds in the back.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I submit Document F-604 as Exhibit Number RF-416, Page 61
of the document book. A civilian was killed in his vineyard. Young
men and girls walking along the road were killed. The motive
was given as “presence of Maquis in the region.” All these victims
were completely innocent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-904, which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-417, Page
62 of your document book. At Culoz “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. young boys were arrested
because they had run away at the sight of the Germans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” They
were reported. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not one of them belonged to the resistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At St. Jean-de-Maurienne—Document F-906, submitted as Exhibit
Number RF-418, Page 63 of your document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 23 August the gendarmes, Chavanne and Empereur,
dressed in civilian clothes, and M. Albert Taravel were
arrested by German soldiers without legitimate reason. The
lieutenant who was in charge of the Kommandantur promised
the officer of the gendarmes to release these three men. This
German later surreptitiously ordered his men to shoot these
prisoners.</p>
<hr class='tbk368'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Mademoiselle Lucie Perraud, 21 years of age, who was a
maid at the Café Dentroux, was raped by a German soldier
of Russian origin, under threat of a pistol.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I will not mention any more of the atrocities described in this
document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the Vercors. This region was undeniably an important
assembly center for French Forces of the Interior. Document
F-611, which we submit as Exhibit Number RF-419, describes
the atrocities committed against the innocent population of this
region in reprisal for the presence of men of the Maquis. This
document appears in your book on Page 69 and following. In Paragraph
3 is an enumeration of police operations in the Vercors area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 15 June, in the region of St. Donat: rape and looting. Execution
at Portes-les-Valence on 8 July 1944 of 30 hostages taken
from among the political prisoners interned at Fort Montluc at
Lyons. Police raids carried out against the Maquis of the Vercors
region from 21 July to 5 August 1944. Rape and looting in the
region of Crest, Saillans, and Die. Bombing by aircraft of numerous
villages in the Vercors area and in particular at La Chapelle and
Vassieux-en-Vercors; summary execution of inhabitants of these
places; looting. Execution, after summary judgment, of about a
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
hundred young men at St. Nazaire-en-Royans; deportation to Germany
of 300 others from this region. Murder of 50 gravely wounded
persons in the Grotto of La Luire. On 15 June 1944, attack by German
troops at St. Donat. I quote, “The Maquis had evacuated the
town several days earlier .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 54 women or young girls from 13 to
50 years of age were raped by the maddened soldiers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will forgive me if I avoid citing the atrocious
details which follow. Bombing of the villages of Combovin, La
Baume-Cornillanne, Ourches, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The losses caused by these bombings among the civilian
population are rather high, for in most cases the inhabitants,
caught by surprise, had no time to seek shelter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 2 women
were raped at Crest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 3 women were raped at Saillans .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk369'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A young girl of twelve, who was wounded and pinned down
between beams, awaited death for 6 long days unable either
to sit down or sleep, and without receiving any food, and that
under the eyes of the Germans who were occupying the village.”—A
medical certificate from Doctor Nicolaides, who
examined the women who were raped in this region.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I will pass on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit Document F-612 under Exhibit Number RF-420. To
terrorize the inhabitants at Trebeurden in Brittany they hanged
innocent people, and slashed the corpses to make the blood flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I proceed. Document F-912 is submitted as Exhibit Number
RF-421, Page 82 of your book. It is the report of the massacre of
35 Jews at St. Amand-Montrond. These men were arrested and
killed with pistol shots in the back by members of the Gestapo and
of the German Army. They were innocent of any crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit Document F-913 as Exhibit Number RF-422—Page 96,
I am quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 8 April 1944 German soldiers of the Gestapo arrested
young André Bézillon, 18 years of age, dwelling at Oyonnax
(Ain), whose brother was in the Maquis. The body of this
young man was discovered on 11 April 1944 at Siège (Jura)
frightfully mutilated. His nose and tongue had been cut off.
There were traces of blows over his whole body and of slashes
on his legs. Four other young men were also found at Siège
at the same time as Bézillon. All of them had been mutilated
in such a manner that they could not be identified. They bore
no trace of bullets, which clearly indicates that they died from
the consequences of ill-treatment.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I submit Document F-614 as Exhibit Number RF-423, at Page 98
of your document book. It describes the destruction of the village
of Cerizay, (Deux-Sèvres). I quote:
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fire did not cause any accident to persons, but the bodies
of two persons killed by German convoys and those of two
victims of the bombardment were burned.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This village was destroyed by artillery fire; 172 buildings were
destroyed and 559 were damaged. We now submit another document,
Document F-919 as Exhibit Number RF-424, Page 103. It concerns
the murder of a young man of Tourc’h in Finistère. The
murderers compelled the mother to prepare a meal for them. Having
been fed, they had the victim disinterred. They searched and found
that the body bore a card of identity bearing the same name and
address as his mother, brothers, and sisters, who were present and
in tears. One of the soldiers, finding no excuse to explain this crime,
said dryly before going away: “He was not a terrorist! What a
pity!” and the body was buried again. Document F-616 submitted
as Exhibit Number RF-425, Page 104, concerns the report of the
operations of the German Army in the region of Nice, about 20 July
1944. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. having been attacked at Presles by several groups of
Maquis in the region, by way of reprisal, this Mongolian
detachment, as usual commanded by the SS, went to a farm
where two French members of the resistance had been hidden.
Being unable to take them prisoners, these soldiers then
arrested the proprietors of that farm (the husband and wife),
and after subjecting them to numerous atrocities, rape, et
cetera, they shot them with submachine guns. Then they took
the son of these victims, who was only 3 years of age; and,
after having tortured him frightfully, they crucified him on
the gate of the farmhouse.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>We submit Document F-914 as Exhibit Number RF-426, Page 107 of
your document book. This is a long recital of murders committed
without any cause whatever by the German Army in Rue Tronchet
at Lyons. I now read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Without preliminary warning, without any effort having
been made to verify the exact character of the situation and,
if necessary, to seize those responsible for the act, the soldiers
opened fire. A certain number of civilians, men, women,
and children fell. Others who were untouched or only slightly
wounded fled in haste.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Tribunal will find the official report that was drawn up on the
occasion of these murders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit without quoting, asking the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of it only, the report relating to the crimes of the German
Army committed in the region of Loches (Indre-et-Loire), Document
F-617, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-427, Page 115 of your document
book.
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-607, submitted as Exhibit Number RF-428, which is
on Page 119 of your document book, describes the looting, rape, and
burnings at Saillans during the months of July and of August 1944.
I quote, “During their sojourn in the region”—referring to German
soldiers—“rapes were committed against three women in that area.”
I pass on. Document F-608, Page 120 of your document book, submitted
as Exhibit Number RF-429: A person was burned alive at
Puisots by a punitive expedition. This person was innocent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit Document F-610 as Exhibit Number RF-430, Page 122
of your document book. The whole region of Vassieux in the Vercors
was devastated. This document, Number F-610, is a report by
the Red Cross prepared prior to the liberation. I am quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“We found on a farm a wounded man, who had been hit by
8 bullets in the following circumstances. The Germans forced
him to set fire to his own house, and tried to prevent him
from escaping the flames by shooting at him with their pistols.
In spite of his wounds, he was able miraculously to escape.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We submit Document F-618 as Exhibit Number RF-431, Page 124
of the document book. I quote, concerning people who were executed:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before being shot these people were tortured. One of them,
M. Francis Duperrier, had a broken arm and his face was
completely mutilated. Another, M. Feroud-Plattet, had been
completely disembowelled with a piece of sharp wood. His
jaw bone was also crushed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We submit Document 605 as Exhibit Number RF-432, Page 126.
This document describes the burning of the hamlet of des Plaines near
Moutiers, in Savoy: “Two women, Madame Romanet, a widow,
72 years old, and her daughter, age 41, were burned to death in a
small room of their dwelling, where they had sought refuge. In the
same place a man, M. Charvaz, who had had his thigh shattered by
a bullet, was also found burned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit as Exhibit Number RF-433 the French Document
F-298, Page 127 and following in your document book, which
describes the destruction of Maillé in the department of Indre-et-Loire.
That area was entirely destroyed on 25 August 1944, and a
large number of its inhabitants were killed or seriously wounded.
This destruction and these crimes had no terrorist action, no action
by the French Forces of the Interior as a motive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document F-907 submitted as Exhibit Number RF-434—Page 132
and following in your document book—relates the incidents leading
to German crimes at Montpezat-de-Quercy. This is a letter written
to the French Delegation by the Bishop of Montauban, Monseigneur
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>
Théas, on 11 December 1945. This document really explains Document
F-673, already submitted as Exhibit Number RF-392, from
which I will read. The first part consists of a letter by the French
Armistice Commission, and has been taken from the archives of the
Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the night of 6 to 7 June last, in the course of an operation
in the region of Montpezat-de-Quercy, German troops set fire
to four farmhouses which formed the hamlet called ‘Perches.’
Three men, two women, and two children, 14 and 4 years old,
were burned alive. Two women and a child of ten who disappeared
probably suffered the same fate.</p>
<hr class='tbk370'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On Saturday, 10 June, having been fired at by two recalcitrants
at the village of Marsoulas, German troops killed these
two men. Moreover, they massacred without any explanation
all the other inhabitants of the village that they could lay
their hands on.</p>
<hr class='tbk371'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Thus 7 men, 6 women, and 14 children were killed, most of
them still in their beds at the early hour when this happened.</p>
<hr class='tbk372'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 10 June, at about 1900 hours, five Luftwaffe aircraft
attacked the town of Tarbes for half an hour with bombs and
machine guns. Several buildings were destroyed, among them
the Hôtel des Ponts et Chaussées, and the Academic Inspectorate.
There were 7 dead and about 10 wounded who were
hit by chance among the population of the town. On this
occasion the general in command of the VS-659 at Tarbes
immediately informed the Prefect of the Department of
Basses-Pyrénées that the operation had been neither caused
nor ordered by him.</p>
<hr class='tbk373'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Following each of these events the Regional Prefect of Toulouse
addressed to the general commanding the HVS-564
letters in which in dignified and measured terms he protested
against the acts in question, through which innocent women
and children were deliberately killed. He asserted very
rightly that under no circumstances could children in the
cradle be considered as accomplices of the terrorists. He
requested finally that instructions be given to avoid the recurrence
of such painful events.</p>
<hr class='tbk374'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Replying on 19 June to the three letters of the Regional
Prefect of Toulouse, the chief of staff of the general commanding
the head liaison staff 564 announced the principles
which determined the position taken by his chief, which justified
the acts of reprisal quoted on the following grounds:</p>
<hr class='tbk375'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The duty of the French population is not only to flee from
terrorists but also to render their operations impossible, which
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
will avoid any reprisals being taken against innocent people.
In the struggle against terrorism the German Army must and
will employ all means at its disposal, even methods of combat
new to Western Europe.</p>
<hr class='tbk376'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The terror raids of the Anglo-Americans also massacre thousands
and thousands of German children. There, too, innocent
blood is being shed through the action of the enemy, whose
support of terrorism is forcing the German soldier to use his
arms in the South of France.</p>
<hr class='tbk377'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I beg to ask you”—concluded General Bridoux, writing to
the German Commission—“whether the French Government
is to consider the arguments cited above as reflecting accurately
the position taken by the German High Command, in
view of the facts disclosed in the first part of the present
letter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We now submit Document E-190 as Exhibit Number RF-435,
Page 141 of the document book, which describes the crimes committed
at Ascq by a German unit which, in reprisal for the destruction
of the railway, massacred 77 men of all categories and all ages,
among whom were 22 employees of the French State railway, some
industrialists, business men, and workmen. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The oldest of these victims, M. Briet, retired, was 74 years
old; he was born on 3 October 1869 at Ascq. The youngest,
Jean Roques, student and son of the postmaster, was 15 years
old, born on 4 January 1929 at Saint Quentin. Father Gilleron,
a priest at Ascq, and his two protegées, M. Averlon and
his son, who had fled from the coast, were also shot.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This massacre was the cause of a protest made by the French
Government at that time, to which Commander-in-Chief Von Rundstedt
replied on 3 May 1944 (Document F-673, already submitted as
Exhibit Number RF-392, Page 154):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The population of Ascq bears the responsibility for the consequences
of its treacherous conduct, which I can only severely
condemn.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>General Bérard, president of the French delegation attached to
the German Armistice Commission, was not satisfied with the reply
given by Rundstedt; and on 21 June 1944 he reiterated the French
protest, addressing it this time to General Vogl, president of the
German Armistice Commission. This is still Document F-673, Exhibit
Number RF-392. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In all, from 10 October 1943 to 1st May 1944, more than 1,200
persons were made the victims of these measures of repression.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk378'/>
<p class='noindent'>“These measures of repression strike the innocent and cause
terror to reign among the French population .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk379'/>
<p class='noindent'>“A great number of the acts that have been mentioned took
place in the course of repressive operations directed against
population accused of having relations with the Maquis. In
these operations there was never any care taken to discover
whether the people suspected of having served the Maquis
were really guilty; and still less in this case, to ascertain
whether these people had acted voluntarily or under duress.
The number of innocent people executed is therefore considerable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk380'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The repressive operation in Dordogne, from 26 March to
3 April 1944, and particularly the tragic affair of Ascq, which
have already brought about the intervention of the head of
the French Government, are grievous examples. At Ascq,
especially, 86 innocent people paid with their lives for an
attempted attack which, according to my information, did not
cause the death of a single German soldier.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk381'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Such acts can only stimulate the spirit of revolt in the adversaries
of Germany, who finally are the only ones to benefit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The reply of the Armistice Commission, Document F-707, submitted
as Exhibit Number RF-436, is the rejection of General
Bérard’s request. The document is before you. I do not think it is
necessary for me to read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general, on 3 August 1944, reiterated his protest. This is
Document F-673, Exhibit Number RF-392, already submitted. At the
end of his protest he writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“An enemy who surrenders must not be killed even though he
is a <span class='it'>franc-tireur</span> or a spy. The latter will receive just punishment
through the courts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But this is only the text of stipulations to be applied within Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We submit Document F-706, Exhibit Number RF-437, which is
a note from the French Secretary of State for Defense to the German
general protesting against the measures of destruction taken
by the German troops in Chaudebonne and Chaveroche. We shall
not read this document. The Tribunal may take judicial notice of
it, if it deems it necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the statement of the events of Tulle, in which
120 Frenchmen were hanged, Page 169 (Document F-673, Exhibit
RF-392). I am quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 7 June a large group of <span class='it'>francs-tireurs</span> attacked the French
forces employed in the maintenance of order and succeeded
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>
in seizing the greater part of the town of Tulle after a struggle
which lasted until dawn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<hr class='tbk382'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The same day, at about 2000 hours, important German
armored forces came to the assistance of the garrison and
penetrated into the city from which the terrorists withdrew
in haste.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These troops, which re-took Tulle, decided to carry out reprisals.
The French Forces of the Interior that had taken the town had
withdrawn. The Germans had taken no prisoners. The reprisals
were carried out upon civilians. Without discrimination they were
arrested.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The victims were selected without any inquiry, without even
any questioning, haphazardly; workmen, students, professors,
industrialists. There were even among them some militia
sympathizers and candidates for the Waffen SS. The 120
corpses which were hanged from the balconies and lamp-posts
of the Avenue de la Gare, along a distance of 500 meters,
were a horrible spectacle that will remain in the memory of
the unfortunate population of Tulle for a long time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the crowning event in these German atrocities:
the destruction of Oradour-sur-Glane, in the month of June 1944.
The Tribunal will accept, we hope, the presentation of Document
F-236, which now becomes Exhibit Number RF-438. This is an official
book, published by the French Government, which gives a full
description of the events. I will give you a brief analysis of the
report which the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government of the time sent to the German
general who was Commander-in-Chief for the regions of the
West:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On Saturday, 10 June, a detachment of SS belonging very
likely to the ‘Das Reich’ division which was present in the
area, burst into the village, after having surrounded it entirely,
and ordered the population to gather in the central square.
It was then announced that it had been reported that explosives
had been hidden in the village and that a search and
the checking of identity were about to take place. The men
were asked to make four or five groups, each of which was
locked into a barn. The women and children were taken to
the church and locked in. It was about 1400 hours. A little
later machine-gunning began and the whole village was set
on fire, as well as the surrounding farms. The houses were
set on fire one by one. The operation lasted undoubtedly
several hours, in view of the extent of the locality.</p>
<hr class='tbk383'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the meantime the women and the children were in anguish
as they heard the sound of the fires and of the shootings. At
1700 hours, German soldiers entered the church and placed
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
upon the communion table an asphyxiating apparatus which
comprised a sort of box from which lighted fuses emerged.
Shortly after the atmosphere became unbreathable. However
someone was able to break open the vestry door which enabled
the women and children to regain consciousness. The German
soldiers then started to shoot through the windows of the
church, and they came inside to finish off the last survivors
with machine guns. Then they spread upon the soil some
inflammable material. One woman alone was able to escape,
having climbed on the window to run away. The cries of a
mother who tried to give her child to her, drew the attention
of one of the guards who fired on the would-be fugitive and
wounded her seriously. She saved her life by simulating
death and she was later cared for in a hospital at Limoges.</p>
<hr class='tbk384'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At about 1800 hours the German soldiers stopped the local
train which was passing in the vicinity. They told passengers
going to Oradour to get off, and, having machine-gunned them,
threw their bodies into the flames. At the end of the evening,
as well as the following day, a Sunday morning, the inhabitants
of the surrounding hamlets, alarmed by the fire or made
anxious because of the absence of their children who had been
going to school at Oradour, attempted to approach, but they
were either machine-gunned or driven away by force by German
sentinels who were guarding the exits of the village.
However, on the afternoon of Sunday some were able to get
into the ruins, and they stated that the church was filled with
the corpses of women and children, all shrivelled up and calcinated.</p>
<hr class='tbk385'/>
<p class='noindent'>“An absolutely reliable witness was able to see the body of
a mother holding her child in her arms at the entrance of the
church, and in front of the altar the body of a little child
kneeling, and near the confessional the bodies of two children
in each other’s arms.</p>
<hr class='tbk386'/>
<p class='noindent'>“During the night from Sunday to Monday the German troops
returned and attempted to remove traces by proceeding with
the summary burial of the women and children outside the
church.</p>
<hr class='tbk387'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The news of this drama began to spread through Limoges on
the 11th of June.</p>
<hr class='tbk388'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the evening, the general commanding the Verbindungsstab
refused to grant the pass, which was personally requested
by the Regional Prefect, for him and the Deputy Prefect to
move about in the area. Only the Subprefect of Rochechouart
was able to go to Oradour and report to his chief on the following
day that the village, which comprised 85 houses, was
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>
only a mass of ruins and that the greater part of the population,
women and children included, had perished.</p>
<hr class='tbk389'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On Tuesday, 13 June, the Regional Prefect finally obtained
authorization to go there and was able to proceed to the town,
accompanied by the Deputy Prefect and the Bishop of Limoges.
In the church, which was partly in ruins, there were still the
calcinated remains of children. Bones were mixed with the
ashes of the woodwork. The ground was strewn with shells
with ‘STKAM’ marked upon them, and on the walls there
were numerous traces of bullets at a man’s height.</p>
<hr class='tbk390'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Outside the church the soil was freshly dug; children’s garments
were piled up, half burned. Where the barns had stood,
completely calcinated human skeletons, heaped one on the
other, partially covered with various material made a horrible
charnel-house.</p>
<hr class='tbk391'/>
<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. although it is impossible to give the exact number of
these victims, it can be estimated that there were 800 to 1,000
dead, among them many children who had been evacuated
from regions threatened by bombardment. There do not seem
to have been more than ten survivors among the persons who
were present in the village of Oradour at the beginning of
the afternoon of 10 June.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Such are the facts.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have the honor, General, to ask you”—concluded General
Bridoux addressing his enemy—“to be good enough to communicate
these facts to the German High Command in France.
I greatly hope that they will be brought to the knowledge of
the Government of the Reich, because of the political importance
which they will assume from their repercussion on the
mind of the French population.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An inquiry has been conducted since; it is summed up in the
book which has just been placed before you. This inquiry has shown
that no member of the French Forces of the Interior was in the village,
that there was none within several kilometers. It seems even
proved that the causes of the massacre of Oradour-sur-Glane are
remote. The unit which perpetrated this crime apparently did so
as an act of vengeance, because of an attempt against it about
50 kilometers further away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Army ordered a judicial inquiry. Document F-673,
already submitted as RF-392, so indicates; Pages 175 and 176. This
document is dated 4 January 1945. There were no Germans in
France at that time, at least not in Oradour-sur-Glane. The version
given by the German authority is that the reprisals appear to be
absolutely justified for military reasons. The German military commander
who was responsible for it fell in combat in Normandy.
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall remember the phrase “The reprisals appear to be absolutely
justified, for military reasons.” Therefore, in the eyes of the
German Army, the crime of Oradour-sur-Glane which I have described
to you plainly, is a crime which is fully justified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guilt of Keitel in all these matters is certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Document F-673, Exhibit Number RF-392—and this will be
the end of my statement—there is a strange document which is
signed by him. It was drawn up on 5 March 1945. It concerns
alleged executions, without trial, of French citizens. You will find it
on Page 177. It will show the Tribunal the manner in which these
criminal inquiries were conducted, on orders, by the German Army,
following incidents as grave as that of Oradour-sur-Glane, which
had to be justified at any price. In this document, which should be
cited in its entirety, I wish only to look at the next to the last paragraph.
It was in the German interest to answer these reproaches as
promptly as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is not a document of which we can take
judicial notice and therefore if you want to put the whole document
in you must put it in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am surprised, Your Honor; you have already
accepted it. This is Document F-673. It was submitted as Exhibit
Number RF-392 and is the whole bundle of documents of the Wiesbaden
German Armistice Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but is it a public document? It is not a
public document, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Am I to understand that the Tribunal wants me
to read it in its entirety?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, F-673 seems to be a very large bundle
of documents. This particular part of it, this document signed by
Keitel, is a private document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is a document which comes from the German
Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden, which was presented several
hours ago under Exhibit Number RF-392, and you accepted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I know we accepted its being deposited, but
that does not mean that the whole of the document is in evidence.
I mean, we have ruled over and over again that documents of which
we do not take judicial notice must be read so that they will go
through the interpreting system and will be interpreted into German
to the German counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am therefore going to give you the reading of the
whole document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.

executions of French citizens without trial.</p>

<hr class='tbk393'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. High Command West.</p>
<hr class='tbk394'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In August 1944, the French Commission attached to the German
Armistice Commission addressed a note to the latter,
giving an exact statement of incidents concerning alleged
arbitrary executions of Frenchmen from 9 to 23 June 1944.</p>
<hr class='tbk395'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The information given in the French note was for the most
part so detailed that verification from the German side was
undoubtedly possible.</p>
<hr class='tbk396'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 26 September 1944 the High Command of the Wehrmacht
entrusted the German Armistice Commission with the study
of this affair. The said commission later requested High
Command West for an inquiry on the incidents and an opinion
on the facts submitted in the French note.</p>
<hr class='tbk397'/>
<p class='noindent'>“On 12 February 1945 the German Armistice Commission
received from the Army Group B (from the President of the
Military Tribunal of Army Group B) a note stating that the
documents referring to this affair had been since November
1944 with the Army Judge of Pz. AOK 6, and that Pz. AOK 6
and the Second SS Panzer Division ‘Das Reich’ had in the
meantime been detached from Army Group B.</p>
<hr class='tbk398'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The manner in which this affair was inquired into causes the
following remarks to be made:</p>
<hr class='tbk399'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The French, that is, the Delegation of the Vichy Government
have in this memorandum brought on the German Wehrmacht
the grave charge of having carried out numerous executions of
French subjects, executions which are unjustified by law and
therefore murders. It was in the interest of Germany to reply
as promptly as possible to such charges. In the long period
which has elapsed since the receipt of the French note it
should have been possible, in spite of the development of the
military situation and the movement of troops resulting therefrom,
to single out at least part of these charges and to refute
them by examination of the facts. If merely one fraction of
the charge had been refuted”—this sentence is important—“it
would have been possible to show the French that all their
claims were based upon doubtful data. By the fact that
nothing at all was done in this matter by the Germans, the
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
enemy must have the impression that we are not in a position
to answer these charges.</p>
<hr class='tbk400'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The study of this matter shows that there is often a considerable
lack of understanding of the importance of counteracting
all enemy propaganda and charges against the German Army
by immediately refuting alleged German atrocities.</p>
<hr class='tbk401'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The German Armistice Commission is hereby entrusted to
continue the study of this matter with all energy. We ask
that every assistance be given them for speeding up this work
now, within their own field of duty. The fact that Pz. AOK 6
is no longer under High Command West is no reason for
impeding the making of the necessary investigations for
clearing up and refuting the French charges.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Dubost, you stated, I think, that this document
implicated Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is signed by Keitel, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Signed by him, yes, but how does it implicate
him in the affair of Oradour?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Mr. President, the French Commission, together
with the <span class='it'>de facto</span> Vichy Government, frequently brought to the
attention of the German authorities not only the atrocities of
Oradbur-sur-Glane, but numerous other atrocities. Orders were
given by Keitel that these facts, which constitute absolute reality
not merely in the eyes of the French but in the eyes of all those
who have objectively and impartially inquired into the matter,
should be examined for the purpose of refuting part of these charges.
This letter refers to the protest lodged earlier by the French, and
we read part of it before you in the course of this examination of
the question, particularly the facts noted in the letter of General
Bridoux which mentions the murder of French people at Marsoulas
in the department of Haute-Garonne, among them fourteen children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you said that that was the last document
you were going to refer to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: It is the last document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Ten minutes past five. Shall we adjourn?
M. Dubost, could you let us know what subject is to be gone into
tomorrow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: Crimes against Humanity, by my colleague
M. Faure. If you will allow me to present my conclusion this
evening—it will not take long. Our work has been delayed somewhat
this afternoon.
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How long do you think you will take,
M. Dubost, to make your concluding statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I think by five-thirty I shall be through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think perhaps, if it is as convenient to you,
we had better hear you in the morning. Is it equally convenient
to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I am at the orders of the Tribunal.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>FORTY-EIGHTH DAY</span><br/> Friday, 1 February 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
Defendants Kaltenbrunner and Seyss-Inquart will be absent from
this morning’s session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. DUBOST: I have now completed my presentation of facts.
This presentation has consisted of a dry enumeration of crimes,
atrocities, extortions of all sorts, which I deliberately presented to
you without any embellishments of oratory. The facts have a
profound eloquence which suffices. These facts are, it seems to me,
definitely established. I do not believe that the Defense, nor history—even
German history—will be able to set aside their essential
aspects. They will no doubt be exposed to criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our evidence was hastily collected in a ruined country whose
every means of communication had been destroyed by an enemy in
flight, in a country where each individual was more concerned with
preparation for the future than with looking back upon the past,
even to exact vengeance, for the future is the life of our children,
and the past is but death and destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the whole of France, for each country in the West, the
demands of daily life, the difficulty of preparing for a better future
once again give full meaning to the words of the Scriptures, <span class='it'>Sinite
mortuos sepelire mortuos</span> (Let the dead bury their dead.); and that
is why in spite of all our efforts, all our endeavors, to prepare the
work of justice which France and universal conscience demand, we
were not able to be more thorough. That is why errors of detail
may have slipped into our work, but the rectifications which time
and the Defense will effect can be only accessory. They will not
eliminate the fact that millions of men have been deported, starved,
exhausted through labor and privation before being put to death,
like cattle without value; that innumerable innocent persons have
been tortured before being turned over to the executioner. Rectifications
may affect circumstances of time, sometimes of place;
they will not change the essential facts even if a few details are
modified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these facts, having been established in their general aspect,
it remains for us to complete our task by giving them juridical
significance, by analyzing them with reference to the law of which
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
they constitute a violation, and by making clear the inculpations,
in other words, by fixing the responsibilities, of each defendant in
respect to a law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What law shall we apply? Taken one by one and separated from
the systematic policy which conceived, willed, and ordered them as
a means of achieving domination through terror and beyond that as
a means of extermination pure and simple; these facts constitute
crimes against common law as much as violations of the laws and
usages of war and of international law. All of them could therefore
be defined separately as a violation of an international convention
and of a penal provision of one or another of our established
domestic laws. Or rather all could be qualified as a violation of a
rule of common law which has emerged from each of our own
domestic laws, as shown by M. De Menthon in his address; of that
common law which, in the last analysis, was designated by him as
being the foundation, as the root of international customs, which,
beyond the Charter itself, is and remains the one and only guide of
your decisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is right to know that this common law springs from our
established laws and, like them, punishes in principle actual misdeeds.
Now, all of our defendants remained physically divorced from
each of the criminal facts which in the ubiquity of their power they
multiplied throughout the world. It was their will which commanded;
but, as Mr. Justice Jackson recalled, they never reddened
their own hands with the blood of their victims. Therefore, if we
refer exclusively to our established laws and especially to French
domestic law, the defendants could not, in any case, be considered
as principal authors but merely as accomplices “who have provoked
the act through abuse of authority or of power.” All of that is
indeed a contradiction to the conception which each person in our
countries holds of the guilt of the major war criminals. To solve
the problem thus would be to narrow singularly the field of responsibility
of each of the defendants. This responsibility would
appear merely accessory, where, in fact, it is the principal responsibility;
it would appear fragmentary, whereas to be truly fixed
it must be presented as one single time, in the whole of their
thoughts, intentions, and acts as chiefs of the Nazi government who
conceived, willed, ordered, or tolerated the development of that
systematic policy of terror and extermination, of which each fact
taken separately is but a particular aspect, merely a constituent
element. Thus a simple reference to common law does not bring us
close enough to reality. If it does not omit, as such, any of the facts
to which guilt attaches, it does leave aside the psychological factor
and does not give us a complete conception of the guilt of the
accused in a single formula embracing all the reality. That is
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>
because common law expresses a certain status of common morality
which is accepted by civilized nations as law for the mutual relations
of citizens. Profoundly imbued with the concept of individualism,
this common law is not adequate to meet the exigencies of collective
life which international morality must govern. Furthermore, this
common law which is the foundation of our tradition has become
static in a Cartesian sense, whereas our custom remains enriched
by all the dynamism of international penal law. The Charter has
not fixed the manner in which we are to qualify in a juridical sense
the facts which I have presented before you. In creating your Tribunal,
the authors of the Charter limited themselves to establishing
the limits of your jurisdiction: War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity,
Crimes against Peace; and even then they did not give an
exhaustive definition of each of these crimes. The Tribunal may
refer on this point to Article 6, paragraphs b and c of the Charter
of the Tribunal. This article gives only an indicative enumeration.
That is because the authors of the Charter bore in mind that international
penal law is only still in the first phase of the birth of a
custom in which law is developed by reaction to the deed and where
the judge intervenes only to save the criminals from individual
vengeance or where law is applied by the judge alone and the
penalty pronounced according to his sole judgment. Thus, the
authors of the Charter abstained from giving us a fixed method of
qualification by reference to common law or on the contrary, to
custom. They did not say to you:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“You will take one by one the criminal facts submitted to you,
and each fact taken separately shall be isolated from the
others to be defined by reference to a stipulation of any one
domestic law or to a synthesis of domestic laws, yielding thus
a common law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Nor did they say to you:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“You will take these scattered criminal facts, you will group
them together to make of them one single crime of which the
definition, respecting in a general sense the rules of common
law, will be essentially determined by the sole intention or
purpose sought, without attempting to seek by analogy any
precedents in the different domestic laws which apply only,
moreover, to an entirely different subject.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The authors of the Charter have left you free, entirely free,
within the limits of custom; and consequently we, ourselves, within
the same limitations are free to propose to you such qualification
which appears to us most practical, which appears to us to come
closest to the changing reality of facts in their relation to the general
principles of law and the broad rules of morality which may seem
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>
to us to be such as to meet best the demands of human conscience
expressed by international public opinion duly enlightened on Hitlerian
atrocities, which will, in fact, remain within the limits of
international penal custom. This custom is indeed still in a formulative
stage; but although this Trial is without precedent, the
problems that are being examined in this Court have arisen before;
and the jurists who preceded us have already given them solutions.
These solutions constitute precedents; and, as such, they constitute
the first elements of your custom. In their memorandum to the
Commission to the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on
Sanctions at the Peace Conference of 1919-1920 the French jurists,
M. Larnaude and M. De Lapradelle wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Criminal law could not foresee that through a singular
defiance of the essential laws of humanity, of civilization, of
honor, an army, by virtue of the instructions of its sovereign,
could systematically lend itself to perform deeds through
the perpetration of acts such as the enemy has not shrunk from
performing in order to achieve success and victory. Therefore,
domestic criminal law has never before been able to
make provisions which would permit the repression of such
acts. And still one must, in the interpretation of every law,
cling to the intention of the law maker.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If, in certain
cases considered particularly propitious, one might succeed
in apprehending individuals bearing responsibility of whom
the Emperor could be considered an accomplice one would
only succeed, and not without difficulty, in narrowing the
field of his responsibility by limiting it to a few precise
cases.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is a very restricted approach to the problem of
William II to diminish it and reduce it to the proportions of
a criminal or a court-martial case.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The high justice which
an anxious world awaits would not be satisfied if the German
Emperor were judged only as an accomplice or even as the
co-author of a common-law crime. His actions as Chief of
State must be considered in conformity with their true juridical
character.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But except for minor details all of this is indeed implicitly contained
in the last paragraph of Article 6 of the Charter of your
Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices participating
in the formulation or execution of a Common Plan or Conspiracy
to commit any of the foregoing crimes”—Crimes
against Peace, War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity—“are
responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution
of such plan.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Fundamentally, all this is within strict conformity with the
primordial German concept of Führertum, which places all responsibility
on the leader and those who are with the leader from the
very start. Thus we can, by as close as possible to reality,
by applying the Charter of 8 August and Article 6 of the Charter
of your Tribunal, by respecting the rules of common law defined by
the chief of our delegation, M. De Menthon, and by following
custom, which is sketched in the field of international penal law,
require of your Tribunal to declare all the defendants guilty of
having, in their role as the chief Hitlerian leaders of the German
people, conceived, willed, ordained, or merely tolerated by their
silence that assassinations or other inhuman acts be systematically
committed, that violent treatment be systematically imposed on
prisoners of war or civilians, that devastations without justification
be systematically committed as a deliberate instrument for the
accomplishment of their purpose of dominating Europe and the
world through terrorism and the extermination of entire populations
in order to enlarge the living space of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More specifically, we ask you to declare Göring, Keitel, and Jodl

of the Hague Convention which prohibits collective sanctions and
reprisals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ask you to find Keitel, Jodl, Kaltenbrunner, Seyss-Inquart,

torture to death of members of the resistance; 3. by ordering
devastations without justification:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To declare Göring, Keitel, Jodl, Speer, and Sauckel guilty of

to expose them to bombings or other risks of war:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To declare Göring, Keitel, Jodl, Kaltenbrunner, and Bormann
guilty of having taken part in the execution of this plan, by personally

combatants, more specifically, of airmen and members of commando
groups as well as the terrorist murder or slow extermination of
certain categories of prisoners of war:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To declare Keitel guilty of having taken part in the execution
of this plan by prescribing the deportation of innocent civilians and
by applying to some of them the NN (Nacht und Nebel) regime
which marked them for extermination:

<p class='pindent'>To declare Jodl guilty of having taken part in the execution of
this plan by ordering the arrest, with a view to deportation, of the
Jews of Denmark:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To declare Frank, Rosenberg, Streicher, Von Schirach, Sauckel,
Frick, and Hess guilty of having taken part in the execution of this
plan, by justifying the extermination of Jews or by working out
a statute with a view to their extermination:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To declare Göring guilty of having taken part in the execution
of this plan: 1. by creating concentration camps and by placing them
under the control of the State Police for the purpose of ridding
National Socialism of any opposition; 2. by tolerating and then by
approving fatal physiological experiments on the effect of cold, and
of increasing or decreasing pressure, which experiments were
carried out—with material provided by the Luftwaffe and controlled
by Dr. Rascher, medical officer of the Luftwaffe detailed to
the concentration camp of Dachau for that purpose—on healthy
deportees who were involuntary subjects for the said experiments
with which he (Göring), as chief, associated himself; 3. by utilizing
in large numbers internees for exhausting labor under inhuman
conditions in the armament factories of the Luftwaffe:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To find Speer guilty of having taken part in the execution of this
plan by employing in large numbers the internees for exhausting
labor under inhumane conditions in the armament factories (Document
Number 1584-PS):</p>

<p class='pindent'>To find Bormann guilty of having taken part in the execution of
this plan by participating in the extermination of internees in concentration
camps (Document Number 654-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to Dönitz, Raeder, Von Papen, Von Neurath,
Fritzsche, Funk, and Schacht, we associate ourselves with the
conclusion of our British and American colleagues. And in connection
with the acts above defined, we ask you further, in accordance
with the stipulation of Article 9 of the Charter of your
Tribunal, to find the OKW and the OKH guilty of the execution of
this plan by having ordered and participated in the deportation of

of this plan by participating in the setting-up of the doctrine of
hostages as a means to terrorize and by prescribing the seizure and
execution of hostages in the countries of the West, by reducing to
a degrading level the material living conditions of prisoners of war, by
depriving the latter of the guarantees granted them by international
custom and by positive international law, by ordering or by
tolerating the employment of prisoners of war in dangerous work
or in labor directly connected with military operations, by ordering
the execution of escaped prisoners or prisoners attempting to escape,
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
and the execution of numerous groups of commandos, and by giving
the SS and SD directives for the extermination of airmen:</p>

<p class='pindent'>To find the OKL guilty of having participated in the execution
of this plan: 1. by employing in large numbers internees in concentration
camps for exhaustive labor under inhuman conditions in
the armament factories of the Luftwaffe; 2. by participating in fatal

decreasing pressure, which experiments were carried out for the
benefit of the Luftwaffe and conducted by Dr. Rascher, medical
officer of the Luftwaffe, attached to the concentration camp at
Dachau (Documents 343-PS, 1610-PS, 669-PS, L-90, 668-PS, UK-56,

<p class='pindent'>To find the Government of the Reich and the Leadership Corps
of the Nazi Party guilty of having, for the purpose of dominating
Europe and the world, conceived and prepared the extermination
of combatants who had surrendered and the demoralization, extensive
exploitation, and extermination of prisoners of war, and having
participated in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such are the juridical qualifications of the facts which I have the
honor of submitting to you. But a few lessons emerge from these
facts. May the Tribunal permit me to state them in conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For hundreds of years humanity has renounced the deportation
of the vanquished, their enslavement, and their annihilation through
misery, through hunger, steel, and fire. It is because a message of
brotherhood had been given to the world, and the world could not
entirely forget this message even in the midst of the horrors of war.
From generation to generation we observed an upward effort ever
since this message of peace had been given. We were confident that
it was without any thought of regressing that man had taken the
view of moral progress which formed a part of the common heritage
of civilized nations. All nations revered, equally, good faith in
relations among individuals. All of them had come to accept good
faith as the law of their mutual relationship. International morality
was little by little emerging and international relationship, like that
between individuals, was more and more falling in line with the
three precepts of the classical Roman jurists: “<span class='it'>Honeste vivere,
alterum non laedere, suum cuique tribuere</span>.” (Live honorably, inflict
no harm on another, give each his due.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every civilized nation had been impregnated with a common
humanism, growth of a long tradition, Christian and liberal. Based
on this common heritage and achieved at the price of given experience,
each nation, enlightened by the well-conceived interests
of man, had understood or was coming to understand that in public
as in private affairs loyalty, moderation, and mutual aid were golden
rules which none could transgress indefinitely and with impunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defeat, the catastrophe which has fallen upon Germany
confirm us in this thought and give only more meaning and more
clarity to the solemn warning addressed to the American people by
President Roosevelt in his address on 27 May 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Although our Navy, our guns, and our planes are the first
line of defense, it is certain that back of all of that there is
the spirit and the morality of a free people which give to their
material defense power, support, and efficiency.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And in this struggle, the echoes of which are still rumbling in our
ears, it was indeed those who could rest their strength upon law,
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
nourish their force with justice, who won out. But because we have
followed step by step the development of the criminal madness of
the defendants and the consequences of that madness throughout
these last years, we must conclude that the patrimony of man, of
which we are the recipients, is frail indeed, that all kinds of regressions
are possible, and that we must with care watch over their
heritage. There is not a nation which, ill-educated, badly led by
evil masters, would not in the long run revert to the barbarity of
the early ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German people whose military virtue we recognize, whose
poets and musicians we love, whose application to work we admire,
and who did not fail to give examples of probity in the most noble
works of the spirit; this German people, which came rather late to
civilization, beginning only with the eighth century, had slowly
raised itself to the ranks of nations possessing the oldest culture.
The contribution to modern or contemporary thought seemed to
prove that this conquest of the spirit was final; Kant, Goethe,
Johann Sebastian Bach belong to humanity just as much as Calvin,
Dante, or Shakespeare; nevertheless, we behold the fact that millions
of innocent men have been exterminated on the very soil of
this people, by men of this people, in execution of a common plan
conceived by their leaders, and this people made not a single effort
to revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is what has become of it because it has scorned the virtues
of political freedom, of civic equality, of human fraternity. This is
what has become of it, because it forgot that all men are born free
and equal before the law, that the essential action of a state has for
its purpose the deeper and deeper penetration of a respect for
spiritual liberty and fraternal solidarity in social relations and in
international institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It allowed itself to be robbed of its conscience and its very soul.
Evil masters came who awakened its primitive passions and made
possible the atrocities which I have described to you. In truth, the
crime of these men is that they caused the German people to retrogress
more than 12 centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their crime is that they conceived and achieved, as an instrument
of government, a policy of terrorism toward the whole of the
subjugated nations and toward their own people; their crime is that
they pursued, as an end in itself, a policy of extermination of entire
categories of innocent citizens. That alone would suffice to determine
capital punishment. And still, the French Prosecution, represented
by M. Faure, intends to present proof of a still greater crime,
the crime of attempting “to obliterate from the world certain ideas
which are called liberty, independence, security of nations, which
are also called faith in the given word and respect for the human
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
person,” the crime of having attempted to kill the very soul, the
spirit of France and other occupied nations in the West. We consider
that to be the gravest crime committed by these men, the
gravest because it is written in the Scriptures, Matthew, XII, 31-32:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
men, but the blasphemy unto the Spirit shall not be forgiven
unto men. Whosoever speaketh against the Spirit shall not be
forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
For the tree is known by its fruit. Race of vipers, how could
ye speak good words when ye are evil.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To M. Faure of the French Delegation</span>] Yes,
M. Faure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. EDGAR FAURE (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Mr. President, Honorable Judges, I have the honor of
delivering to the Tribunal the concluding address of the French
Prosecution. This presentation relates more particularly to the
sections lettered (I) and (J) of Count Three of the Indictment: oath
of allegiance and Germanization; and on the other hand to section
(B) of Count Four, persecutions on political, racial, and religious
grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all I should like to present in a brief introduction
the general ideas which govern the plan of my final pleading. The
concept of Germanization has been stated in the presentation of
M. De Menthon. It consists essentially in imposing upon the
inhabitants of occupied territories norms for their political and
social life such as the Nazis had determined according to their own
doctrine and for their own profit. The combined activities which
carried out Germanization or which have Germanization for their
purpose, and which are illegal, have been defined as a criminal
undertaking against humanity. The complete process of Germanization
was employed in certain territories to annex them to the
Reich. The Germans intended even before the end of the war to
incorporate these territories within their own country. These territories,
annexed and then germanized in an absolute manner, are the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Belgian Cantons of Eupen,
Malmédy, and Moresnet, and the three French Departments of
Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin and the Moselle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These territories can be considered relatively small in comparison
with the total area of the territories occupied by the Germans.
This in no wise mitigates the reprehensible character of these
annexations; moreover, we should note at this point two essential
aspects of our subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first proposition: The Germans had conceived and prepared
more extensive annexations than those actually carried out in an
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
official manner. For reasons of expediency, they did not proceed
with these annexations during the period of time at their disposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second proposition: Annexation, on the other hand, was not
the unique or obligatory procedure of Germanization. The Nazis
discovered that they could employ different and various means to
achieve their purpose of universal domination. The selection of
means which vary according to circumstances, to attain and to
camouflage an identical result, was characteristic of what has been
called Nazi Machiavellism. Their conception is technically much
more pliable, more clever, and more dangerous than the classical
conception of territorial conquest. In this respect the most brutal
competitor has over them the advantage of candor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To begin with I say that the Germans had formulated the plan
to annex more extensive territory. Numerous indications point to
this. I would like to give you only two citations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of these is taken from the documentation collected by
our colleagues of the American Prosecution, an American document
which has not yet been submitted to the Tribunal. I should say in
addition that in my final pleading I shall refer only twice to very
remarkable American documents. All the other documents which
I shall submit will be new ones belonging to the French Prosecution.
The document of which I speak now is Number 1155-PS of the
American documents, and it appears in the file of documents submitted
to you under Number RF-601, which will become, may it
please the Tribunal, that number in French documentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is dated Berlin, 20 June 1940. It bears the
notation: “Top Secret Staff Document.” Its title is: “Note for the
Dossier on the Conference of 19 June 1940, at Headquarters of
General Field Marshal Göring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The notes which are included in this document reflect, therefore,
the views of the leaders and not individual interpretations. I would
like to read to the Tribunal only Paragraph 6 of that document,
which is to be found on Page 3. It is the first document bearing
Number RF-601 (Document Number 1155-PS), I proceed with the
reading of Paragraph 6, Page 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“General plans regarding the political development.</p>
<hr class='tbk402'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Luxembourg is to be annexed by the Reich. Norway is to
become German. Alsace-Lorraine is to be reincorporated into
the Reich. An autonomous Breton state is to be created. Considerations
are pending concerning Belgium, the special treatment
of the Flemish in that country, and the creation of a
State of Burgundy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The second citation which I shall submit to the Tribunal on this
point refers to a French document which I submit as Document
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>
Number RF-602. This document comprises the minutes of the interrogation
of Dr. Globke, a former assistant of State Secretary of the
Ministry of the Interior, Dr. Stuckart. It is dated 25 September 1945.
This interrogation was taken by Major Graff of the French Judicial
Service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the minutes of the interrogation has been added a memorandum
which was delivered following the questioning by Dr. Globke.
I read a passage from this interrogation, at the beginning of the
document, Paragraph 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Have you any knowledge of plans which envisage
the annexation of other French territories at the conclusion of
peace between Germany and France? (Belfort, Nancy, Bassin
de Briey, the coal fields of the North, the so-called “Red
Zone”, territory attached to the Government General of Belgium)?’</p>
<hr class='tbk403'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘Yes, those plans did exist. They were worked out
by Dr. Stuckart, upon the personal instruction of the Führer,
and I have seen them. They were communicated to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, to the OKW, and to the Armistice
Commission in Wiesbaden. All these documents have been
destroyed (Dr. Globke maintains). The State Secretary,
M. Stuckart, was ordered to deliver a preliminary draft at
the headquarters of the Führer (End of 1940, before the
launching of the Russian campaign).</p>
<hr class='tbk404'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘After examination the Führer considered the proposal was
too moderate; and he ordered provisions for the incorporation
of further territories, specifically those along the Channel.</p>
<hr class='tbk405'/>
<p class='noindent'>“ ‘Dr. Stuckart then prepared a second draft, with a map
attached, on which the approximate borders were indicated.
I have seen it, and I can show it to you roughly on a large scale
map of France. I do not know whether this second plan
was approved by Hitler.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Faure, did you tell us who Dr. Globke was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Yes, Mr. President, he was the assistant of Dr.
Stuckart, State Secretary in the Ministry of Interior. He styled
himself in his interrogation “officer in charge of matters concerning
Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg in the Ministry of the Interior,
since 1940.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now read a passage from the attached memorandum. This
appears in your document book immediately after the passage I
have just read. Still under Document Number RF-602, I now read
Paragraph 6 of the memorandum in question; it is the beginning of
the document before your eyes.
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The plan of a new Franco-German border was elaborated
upon in the Ministry of Interior by the State Secretary Dr.
Stuckart, upon the order given to him by Hitler. This plan
envisaged that the territory in the north and the east of
France which, for historical, political, racial, geographical, or
any other reasons ostensibly did not belong to western but
to central Europe, should be given back to Germany. A first
draft was submitted to Hitler at his general headquarters and
it was approved by him in full. Hitler nevertheless wanted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The Defense has not received these documents.
Consequently, even today we are not in a position to follow the
presentation. Above all, we are not in a position to check individually
whether the validity of these documents really exists at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Faure, is that correct, that none of these
documents have been deposited in the Defense Information Center?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: They have been deposited with two photostatic
copies in the document center of the defendants’ counsel. Moreover,
before I complete my statement, I think that the Defense Counsel
will have full opportunity to study this very brief document and
to make any observations which he may desire; but I can give you
assurance that those documents were delivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What assurance can you give me that the
orders which the Tribunal has given have been carried out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The documents have been delivered to the Defense
Counsel in accordance with instruction and two photostatic copies
have been delivered in the document room of the Defense. These
documents are, moreover, in the German language, which should
greatly facilitate the task of the Defense Counsel, as the interrogation
was taken in the German language by an officer of the French
Judiciary Services.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, did you hear what M. Faure said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I should certainly not raise any objections if
these documents had actually been sent to our document room and
put at our disposal. This morning I and several others looked into
the matter and made an effort to determine whether the documents
were really there. We could not find out. Dr. Steinbauer and I went
there; we could not find the documents. I shall go there again to
see whether they may not have come in the meantime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has stated on a variety of
occasions that they attach a great importance to the documents being
deposited in the defendants’ Information Center and copies supplied
in accordance with the regulations which they have laid down.
Whether that has been done on this occasion, is disputed by Dr.
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>
Stahmer. The Tribunal proposes therefore to have the matter
investigated as soon as possible and to see exactly whether the rules
have been carried out or not. And in future they hope that they
will be carried out with the greatest strictness. In the meantime,
I think it will be most convenient for you to continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The defendants’ counsel tells me that the documents
are in the Defense Counsel Room, but they have not yet been
distributed. It can be seen, therefore, that the orders were fully
respected; but because of the burden of work it may be that the
Defense may not individually have received these documents. In
any event, I am prepared to submit immediately to the Defense
Counsel mainly concerned with this, photostatic copies which will
enable them to follow my reading of the documents, which, incidentally,
are quite brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal will have the facts
investigated by the Marshal. And in the meantime, you can continue.
The Marshal of the Court will immediately find out and report to
the Tribunal what the facts are about the deposition of the documents
and the time at which they were deposited. In the meantime
you can continue, and we shall be glad if you will assist the
defendants’ counsel by giving them any copies you may have
available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I was reading then, Document Number RF-602, the
attached memorandum. If the Tribunal wishes to follow the reading
of this document will it kindly take the book entitled “Exposé” or
“Presentation,” and turn to Page 6 thereof. The passage which I am
now coming to is the last paragraph of Page 6. “Introduction—Exposé,”
Page 6, third and last paragraph, I am continuing:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“A first draft was submitted to Hitler at his general headquarters
and was approved by him as a whole; but, nevertheless,
he called for an enlargement of the territory falling to
Germany, in particular, along the Channel coast. The final
draft was to serve as the basis for future discussions with the
administrative departments concerned. These discussions did
not take place. The intended frontier followed approximately
a course beginning at the mouth of the Somme, turning
eastward along the northern edge of the Paris Basin and
Champagne to the Argonne, then bent to the south crossing
Burgundy, and westward of the Franche-Comte, reaching the
Lake of Geneva. For some districts alternative solutions
were suggested.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These German plans were indicated on several occasions by
specific measures having to do with the territories in question,
measures which might be designated preannexation measures.
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now to the second proposal which I referred to a while
ago. With or without annexation, the Germans had in mind to
take and maintain under their domination all the occupied
countries. As a matter of fact their determination was to germanize
and to nazify all of Western Europe and even the African Continent.
This intention appears from the very fact of the conspiracy which
has been laid bare before the Tribunal so completely by my
colleagues of the American Prosecution. That will also be shown
by the applications made of it, of which the principal ones will be
retraced in this concluding address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I merely want to recall to the Tribunal this general point that
the plan for Germanic predominance is defined according to the
German interpretation itself in a public diplomatic document, which
is the Tripartite Pact of 27 September 1940 between Germany,
Italy, and Japan. In this connection I would like to quote before
the Tribunal a few sentences of a comment made upon this treaty
by an official German author, Von Freytagh-Loringhoven, a
member of the Reichstag, who wrote a book on German foreign
policy from 1933 to 1941. This book was published in a French
translation in Paris at the publishing house of Sorlot, during the
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not want to submit this as a document, but merely as a
quotation from a published work, a book, which is here in your
hands. I read from Page 311:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This treaty granted Germany and Italy a dominant position
in the new European order, and it accorded Japan a similar
role in the area of eastern Asia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I am now skipping a sentence that has no significance.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At first glance, one could realize that the Tripartite Pact
had in mind a double purpose.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I shall skip the following sentence which is without interest, and
I go to the sentence dealing with the second purpose:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, it entrusted the parties with a mission for the
future, that is to say, the establishment of a new order in
Europe and eastern Asia.</p>
<hr class='tbk406'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Without seeking to lessen the importance of the first
question, there can be no doubt that this second purpose,
dealing with the future, involved vaster projects and was, in
fact, the principal point. For the first time in an international
treaty, in the Tripartite Pact, the terms ‘space’ and ‘orientation’
were used linking one with the other.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now go to Page 314 where the author makes a remark which
appears to me to be significant:
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Now, the Tripartite Pact places a clear delimitation of the
wider spaces created by nature on our globe. The concept of
space, it is true, is employed explicitly only for the Far East,
but it is equally applicable to Europe and that within this
conception Africa is comprised. The latter is certainly
politically and economically a complement, or if one wishes,
an annex of Europe. Moreover, it is obvious that the
Tripartite Pact fixes the limits of the two great regions or
spaces reserved for the partners, that the pact tacitly
recognizes the third area, that is Asia, properly speaking,
and that it leaves aside the fourth, the American Continent,
thus leaving the latter to its own destiny. In this way the
whole surface of the globe is concerned; and an idea, which
as yet has not been considered except in theory, was given
the significance of a political principle derived from international
law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I have felt that this text was of interest because, on the one
hand, it clarifies the fact that the African Continent is itself
included in the space reserved to the German claimants, and on the
other, it states that the government of such an immense space by
Germany constitutes international law. This pretense of acting
juridically is one of the characteristics of the undertaking to
germanize the world from 1940 to 1945. It is undoubtedly one of
the reasons which inspired Nazi Germany to proceed only on rare
occasions by the annexation of territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annexation is not indispensable for the domination of a great
area. It can be replaced by other methods which correspond
rather accurately to the usual term of “vassalization.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you not think this will be a convenient
time to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, before resuming my brief, I should
like to ask the Tribunal if they could agree to hear, during the
afternoon session, a witness who is M. Reuter, President of the
Chamber of Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly, M. Faure, if that is convenient to
you, the Tribunal is quite willing to hear the witness you name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I propose on those conditions to have him heard at
the beginning of the second part of the afternoon session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pointed out a moment ago that the different methods of
disguised annexation can correspond to the term “vassalization.”
From a German author I shall borrow a formula which is eloquent.
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>
It is Dr. Sperl, in an article in the <span class='it'>Krakauer Zeitung</span>, who used
this expression: “A differentiation in methods of German
domination.” In using, thus, indirect and differentiated methods
of domination, the Germans acted in political matters, as we have
seen before, in the same way as they acted in economic matters.
I had the opportunity to point out to the Tribunal, in my first
brief, that the Germans immediately seized the keys of economic
life. If you will permit me to use this Latin expression, I shall
say as far as sovereignty in the occupied countries is concerned,
they insured for themselves the power of the keys, “<span class='it'>potestas
clavium</span>.” They seized the keys of sovereignty in each country. In
that fashion, without being obliged to abolish officially national
sovereignty as in the case of annexation, they were able to control
and direct the exercise of this sovereignty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning with these principle ideas, the plan of my brief was
conceived as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first chapter I shall examine the regime in annexed
territories where national sovereignty was abolished. In a second
chapter I shall examine the mechanism of the seizure of sovereignty
for the benefit of the occupying power in the regions which were
not annexed. Then it will be suitable to examine the results of
these usurpations of sovereignty and the violation of the rights
of the population which resulted from them. I thought it necessary
that I should group these results by dealing with the principal
ones in a third and fourth chapter. The third chapter will be
devoted to spiritual Germanization, that is, to the propaganda in
the very extensive sense that the German concept gives to this
term. Chapter four, and the last, will bear the heading, “The
Administrative Organization of Criminal Action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would now like to point out, as far as the documentation of
my brief is concerned, I have forced myself to limit the number
of texts which will be presented to the Tribunal; and I shall
attempt to make my quotations as short as possible. For the fourth
chapter, for example, I might point out that the French Delegation
examined more than 2,000 documents, counting only the original
German documents, of which I have kept only about fifty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like also to point out to the Tribunal how the documents
will be presented in the document books which you have
before you. The documents are numbered at the top of the page
to the right; they are numbered in pencil and correspond to the
order in which I shall quote them. Each dossier has a pagination
which begins with the number 100.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would ask the Tribunal now to take up the document book
entitled: “The Annexed Territories of Eupen, Malmédy, and
Moresnet.”
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In carrying out, without any attempt or cloak of legality, the
annexation of occupied territories, Germany did something much
more serious than violating the rules of law. It is the negation of
the very idea of international law. The lawyer, Bustamante y
Sirven, in his treatise on international law expresses himself in
the following terms regarding this subject:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It can be observed that never have we alluded at any
moment to the hypothesis that an occupation terminates
because the occupying power takes possession of the occupied
territory through his military forces and without any convention.
The motive for this mission is very simple and
very clear. Since conquest cannot be considered as a legitimate
mode of acquisition, these results are uniquely the result
of force and can be neither determined nor measured by
the rules of law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, I have said just now that Germanization
did not necessarily imply annexation. Inversely, we might conceive
that annexation did not necessarily mean Germanization. We shall
prove to the Tribunal that annexation was only a means, the most
brutal one of Germanization, that is to say, nazification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The annexation of the Belgian cantons of Eupen, Malmédy, and
Moresnet was made possible by a German law of 18 May 1940 and
was the subject of an executive decree of 23 May 1940. These are
public regulations, which were published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Pages 777 and 804. I should like to ask the Tribunal to take
judicial notice of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of this decree the three Belgian districts were
attached to the province of the Rhineland, district of Aachen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A decree dated 24 September 1940 installed local German
government and German municipal laws. A decree of 28 July 1940
introduced the German judicial system in these territories. Local
courts were established in Malmédy, in Eupen and St. Vith, and
district courts at Aachen, which could judge cases on equality with
the local courts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Court of Appeal of Cologne replaced the Belgian Court
of Cassation for cases where the latter would have been competent.
German law was introduced in these territories by the decree of
23 May 1940, signed by Hitler, Göring, Frick, and Lammers and
was effective as from September 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A decree of 3 September 1940 regulates the details of the
transition of Belgian law into German law in the domains of
private law, commercial law, and law of procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the decree of annexation German nationality was conferred
upon the inhabitants of German racial origin in this Belgian
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>
territory. The details of this measure were specified and stipulated
by the decree of 23 September 1941. All persons who had acquired
Belgian nationality as a result of the ceding of these territories
could, according to the terms of the decree, resume their German
nationality, with the exception, however, of Jews and Gypsies. All
the other inhabitants, on condition that they were racially German,
could acquire German nationality, which might be revoked after
10 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not take up at great length the situation which resulted
from the annexation of these Belgian territories, for the developments
of the situation are analogous to those which we shall
examine in the other countries. I simply would like to point out
a special detail of this subject: A law of 4 February 1941, signed
by Hitler, Göring, Frick, and Lammers granted the citizens of
Eupen, Malmédy, and Moresnet representation in the Reichstag,
that is to say, the benefits of the German parliamentary regime,
the democratic character of which is known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall ask the Tribunal to now take up the file entitled “Alsace
and Lorraine.” There is a file, “Exposé,” and a file, “Documents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Contrary to what took place in the Belgian cantons the Germans
did not officially proclaim by law the annexation of the three
French departments which constitute Alsace and Lorraine. The fact
of this annexation, however, is in no way doubtful. I should like
to remind the Tribunal here of extracts from a document which
has already been submitted to it, which is Document Number RF-3
of the French documentation. It concerns a deposition made before
the French High Court of Justice, by the French Ambassador,
Léon Noël, who was a member of the Armistice Delegation. I did
not put this document in your book because I shall cite only one
sentence from it. The document has already been submitted to the
Tribunal, as I have just said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ambassador Noël, in this document, pointed out the conversations
which he had at the time of the signing of the Armistice
Convention with the German representatives, notably with the
accused Keitel and Jodl. The sentence which I would like to
remind the Tribunal of is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and likewise, in thinking of Alsace and Lorraine, I
required them to say that the administrative and judicial
authorities of the occupied territories would keep their
positions and functions and would be able to correspond
freely with the government.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The affirmations are dated 22 June 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am now going to submit to the Tribunal a document of 3 September
1940, which is a note of protest of the French Delegation,
addressed to the Armistice Commission. I submit this to the
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
Tribunal in order that the Tribunal may see that during the period
which elapsed between these two dates, a period which covers
barely 2 months, the Nazis had applied a series of measures which
created, in an incontestable manner, a state of annexation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document which I submit bears the Number RF-701 of the
French documentation. It is the first document of the document
book which the Tribunal has before it. All the documents in this
chapter will bear numbers beginning with the Number 7, that
is to say, beginning with RF-701.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document comes from the file of the French High Court
of Justice, and the copy submitted to the Tribunal has been
certified by the clerk of this jurisdiction. I should like to quote
from this document, beginning with the fourth paragraph on Page 1
of the Document Number RF-701:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“1. Prefects, subprefects, and mayors, as well as a number
of local officials whose tendencies were considered suspicious,
have been evicted from their respective offices.</p>
<hr class='tbk407'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Monseigneur Heintz, bishop appointed under the Concordat
to Metz, was driven from his diocese. Several members of
the clergy, secular as well as regular, were also expelled
under the pretext that they were French in tongue and
mentality.</p>
<hr class='tbk408'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Monseigneur Ruch, the bishop appointed under the Concordat
to Strasbourg, was forbidden to enter his diocese and,
consequently, to resume his ministry.</p>
<hr class='tbk409'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. M. Joseph Bürckel was appointed on 7 August, Gauleiter
of Lorraine and M. Robert Wagner, Gauleiter of Alsace. The
first of these provinces was attached to the Gau of Saar-Palatinate;
the second to the Gau of Baden.</p>
<hr class='tbk410'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Alsace and Lorraine were incorporated in the civil
administration of Germany. The frontier and custom police
were then placed on the western limits of these territories.</p>
<hr class='tbk411'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. The railroads were incorporated in the German network.</p>
<hr class='tbk412'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. The post office, telegraph, and telephone administration
was taken over by the German postal authorities, who
gradually substituted their own personnel for the Alsatian
personnel.</p>
<hr class='tbk413'/>
<p class='noindent'>“8. The French language was eliminated, not only in administrative
life but also from public use.</p>
<hr class='tbk414'/>
<p class='noindent'>“9. Names of localities were germanized.</p>
<hr class='tbk415'/>
<p class='noindent'>“10. The racial legislation of Germany was introduced into
the country; and as a result of this measure, the Jews were
expelled as well as nationals which the German authorities
considered to be intruders.
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk416'/>
<p class='noindent'>“11. Only the Alsatians and Lorrainers who agreed to consider
themselves as being of German stock were permitted to return
to their homes.</p>
<hr class='tbk417'/>
<p class='noindent'>“12. The property of associations of a political character
and of Jews was confiscated as well as property acquired
after 11 November 1918 by French persons.</p>
<hr class='tbk418'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Nothing illustrates better the spirit which animates these
measures, in themselves arbitrary, than the words pronounced
publicly 16 July at Strasbourg by M. Robert Wagner.
Stressing the elimination of all elements of foreign stock or
nationality which was taking place, this high official affirmed
that the purpose of Germany was to settle once and for
all the Alsatian question.</p>
<hr class='tbk419'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Such a policy, which could not be the function of subordinate
occupational authorities, was equivalent to disguised annexation
and is strictly contrary to agreements subscribed
to by Germany at Rethondes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Numerous protests were subsequently lodged by the French
Delegation. We have attached to our file a list of these protests;
there are 62 of them. This list is found in the book under the
Document Number RF-702.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The development of the German policy may now be studied
through three series of measures which were carried out. First, a
body of measures destined to assure the elimination of what can
be called the French complex, that is to say, of everything which
can tie an inhabitant of an annexed country to his way of life and
to his national tradition. Second, a body of measures destined to
impose German standards in all domains of life of the population.
Third, the measures of transportation and of colonization. We use
here the German terminology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, elimination of the French complex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elimination of French nationality and of French law resulted
automatically from the measures which we shall study relative to
the imposition of German standards. I should like to point out
particularly, that the Germans tried to fight against all elements
of French organization which might have survived the suppression
of their national juridical conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they proscribed, in an extraordinarily brutal way, the
use of the French language. Several regulations were formulated
relative to this. I shall cite only the third regulation, bearing the
date of 16 August 1940, entitled, “Concerning the Reintroduction of
the Mother Tongue.” This document is published in the Journal
of German Ordinances or Decrees of 1940, (<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>) on
Page 2. It bears Document Number RF-703. The Tribunal will
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
find it in the document book after the Document Number 702,
which is the list of French protests. I should like to read a large
part of this document, which is interesting; and I shall start at the
beginning:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Following the measures undertaken with a view of reintroducing
the mother tongue of the Alsatian people, I decree
as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk420'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Official Language.</p>
<hr class='tbk421'/>
<p class='noindent'>“All public services in Alsace, including administration of
communes, of corporations within the meaning of civil law,
public establishments, churches, and foundations, as well as
tribunals, will use exclusively the German language orally
and in writing. The Alsatian population will use exclusively
its German mother tongue in both oral and written applications
to the above establishments.</p>
<hr class='tbk422'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Christian and Family Names.</p>
<hr class='tbk423'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Christian names will be exclusively used in their German
form orally and in writing, even when they have been
inscribed in the French language on the birth register. As
soon as this present decree comes into force, only German
Christian names may be inscribed upon the birth register.
Alsatians who bear French Christian names, which do not
exist in German form, are asked to apply for a change of
their Christian names in order to show their attachment to
Germanism. The same holds good for French family names.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall skip the following sentence and go to Paragraph 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“4. It is forbidden to draw up, in the French language,
contracts and accounts under private seal of whatever nature
they may be. Anything printed on business paper and on
forms must be drawn up in the German language. Books
and accounts of all business firms, establishments, and
companies must be kept in the German language.</p>
<hr class='tbk424'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Inscriptions in Cemeteries.</p>
<hr class='tbk425'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the future, inscriptions on crosses and on tombstones
can be written only in the German language. This provision
applies as well to a new inscription as to the renewal of old
inscriptions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These measures were accompanied by a press campaign. Because
of the resistance of the population, this campaign was carried on
throughout the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to make one citation of an article which is particularly
significant, published in the <span class='it'>Dernières Nouvelles de Strasbourg</span>
on 30 March 1943. This is not introduced as a document;
it is a quotation of a published article. When we read such
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>
an article, we think it at first a joke; but we see, subsequently,
that it is serious because repressive measures had to be taken
against people who sabotaged the German language. I cite:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germans greet one another with ‘Heil Hitler.’ We do not
want any more French greetings, which we still hear constantly
in a thousand different forms. The elegant salutation
‘Bonjour’ is not made for these rough Alsatian throats, accustomed
to the German tongue since the distant epoch of
Osfried von Weissenburg. The Alsatian hurts our ears when
he says ‘boschurr.’ When he says ‘Au Revoir,’ the French
think they are listening to an Arabic word, which sounds
like ‘arwar.’ Sometimes they say ‘Adje’ (Adieu).</p>
<hr class='tbk426'/>
<p class='noindent'>“These phonetic monstrosities which disfigure our beautiful
Alsatian-Germanic dialect resemble a thistle in a flower bed.
Let us weed them out! They are not worthy of Alsace. Do
you believe feminine susceptibility is wounded by saying
‘Frau’ instead of ‘Madame’? We are sure that Alsatians will
drop the habit of linguistic whims so that the authorities
will not have to use rigorous measures against saboteurs of
the German language.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After this attack on the language, the National Socialists attacked
music. This is the purpose of a decree of 1 March 1941, signed by
Dressler, the Chief of the Department of Public Enlightenment and
Propaganda in the Office of the Chief of Civil Administration for
Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is Document Number RF-704, published in the German
Official Journal (<span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>) Page 170 of the year 1941. I
shall simply cite the title of this decree: “Decree Concerning
Undesirable and Injurious Music.” The first 3 lines are:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Musical works contrary to the cultural will of National
Socialists will be entered on a list of undesirable and injurious
music by the Department for Public Enlightenment and
Propaganda.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After music, now, we have the question of hairdress. In this
regulation the ridiculous constantly disputes supremacy with the
odious. I would almost like to ask the Tribunal to pardon me, but,
truly, nothing in this is invented by us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is Document Number RF-705. It is a decree of 13 December
1941 published in the Official Bulletin of 1941, Page 744. This
Document RF-705 concerns the wearing of French berets (Basque
berets) in Alsace. I read only the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The wearing of French berets (Basque berets) is forbidden
in Alsace. Under this prohibition are included all berets
which by form or appearance resemble French berets.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I may add that any violation of this decree was punishable by
fine or imprisonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaders also undertook a long struggle against French flags
which the inhabitants kept in their houses. I cite as an example
Document Number RF-706, a German administrative document
which we found in the archives of the Gau Administration of
Strasbourg. It is dated 19 February 1941. I read 3 paragraphs of
this document.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Gauleiter desires that the Alsatian population be recommended
by the organization of the Block-&nbsp;and Zellenleiter
to rip up the French flags still in possession of the people and
to use them in a suitable way for household needs.</p>
<hr class='tbk427'/>
<p class='noindent'>“By the 1st of next May no French flag should be in private
hands. This goal should be attained in a way by which the
Blockleiter are to visit each household and recommend the
families to use the flags for household needs. It should also
be pointed out that after the 1st of next May corresponding
conclusions shall be drawn concerning the attitude of owners
if, after this date, French flags are still found in private
possession.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The following document is our Document Number RF-707, which
is also an administrative memorandum on the same subject, dated
Strasbourg, 26 April 1941, of which I should simply like to read
the last sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If, after 1 June 1941, Alsatians are found still to have French
flags in their possession, they are to be sent to a concentration
camp for one year.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis feared French influence to such a degree that they
even took a special measure to prevent the coming to Alsace of
French workers among the laborers brought into this territory for
compulsory labor service. This is the purpose of a memorandum
of 7 September 1942 of the civil administration in Alsace, which
is our Document Number RF-708, also found in the archives of
the Gauleitung of Strasbourg. I read the first few lines of this
Document Number RF-708.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Given the general situation of the labor market, the Chief
of the Civil Administration in Alsace has decided that foreign
labor from all European countries could, in the future, be
used in Alsace. There is but one exception, for French and
Belgians, who cannot be employed in Alsace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German undertaking against the French sentiment of
Alsatians .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The translation which came through to me
came to me as “must.” It came through that the foreign workers of
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>
all countries of Europe <span class='it'>must</span>, in the future, be used. The word is
“pouvait.” That does not mean “must,” does it? It is “pouvait.”
Does not that mean “could”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: “Could,” according to necessity. The interesting
aspect is that those who are French may not work there, even
if labor is needed in Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German undertaking against the French sentiments of the
Alsatians found its complementary aspect in the attempt also
to destroy, on the outside, anything which might be an indication of
Alsace belonging to the motherland, France. I shall cite one example
in relation to this point. This is our Document Number RF-709.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a letter of the German Embassy in Paris, 7 May 1941, which
is reproduced in a memorandum of the French Delegation, which
is found in the archives of the government. I read this Document
Number RF-709, which is short:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Embassy has the honor to point out the
following to the General Delegation of the French Government
in occupied territory:</p>
<hr class='tbk428'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The German Embassy has been informed that in a series of
reports on a theme concerning the fatherland, a French radio
station in the unoccupied territory, on 16 or 17 April 1941,
about 2100 hours, is said to have made a broadcast about the
village of Brumath.</p>
<hr class='tbk429'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As Brumath, near Strasbourg, is in a German language
territory, the German Embassy requests that they inform
it if such a broadcast was actually made.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There exist numerous claims and protests of this kind, which
fortunately have often an anecdotal character. We must now cite
two especially serious cases, for they included assault, flagrant
violations of sovereignty, and even crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first case concerns the seizure and profanation of the
treasure of the Cathedral of Strasbourg. I shall submit, concerning
this subject, Document Number RF-710, which is a letter of protest
of 14 August 1943 written by General Bérard, President of the
French Delegation of the Armistice Commission. I read the beginning
of the letter and repeat that the date is 14 August 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dear General,</p>
<hr class='tbk430'/>
<p class='noindent'>“From the beginning of the war, the treasure of Strasbourg
Cathedral and the property of certain parishes of this diocese
had been entrusted by Monseigneur Ruch, Bishop of Strasbourg,
to the Beaux-Arts Department. This department had
put them in a safe place in the castles of Hautefort and of
Bourdeilles in Dordogne, where they still were on the date
of 20 May 1943.
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk431'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The treasure and this property included, in particular, the
pontificalia reserved for the exclusive use of the Bishop,
several of which were his personal property, the relics of
saints, vessels, or objects for the performance of ceremonies.</p>
<hr class='tbk432'/>
<p class='noindent'>“After having sought on several occasions—but in vain—to
obtain the consent of Monseigneur Ruch, the Ministerial
Counsellor Kraft, on 20 May, requested not only the prefect
of Dordogne, but also the director of religious matters, for
authority to remove the objects deposited. Faced with the
refusal of these high officials, he declared that the repatriation
to Alsace of the property of the Catholic Church
would be entrusted to the Sicherheitspolizei.</p>
<hr class='tbk433'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As a result, at dawn on 21 May, the castles of Hautefort
and Bourdeilles were opened and occupied by troops, despite
the protests of the guardian. The sacred objects were placed
in trucks and taken to an unknown destination.</p>
<hr class='tbk434'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This seizure, moreover, was extended to consecrated vessels
and ceremonial objects and the relics of saints worshipped
by the faithful. The seizure of these sacred objects by laymen
not legally authorized and the conditions under which the
operation was carried out aroused the emotion and unanimous
reprobation of the faithful.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Relative to this document I would like to emphasize to the
Tribunal one fact which we shall find frequently hereafter, and
which is, in our opinion, very important in this Trial. It is the
constant interference and collaboration of different or diverse
German administrations. Thus, the Tribunal must through this
document see that Ministerial Counsellor Kraft, belonging to the
civilian service dealing with national education, appeals to the
police of the SS to obtain objects which he cannot obtain through
his own efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second case which I would like to cite concerns the
University of Strasbourg. From the beginning of the war the
University of Strasbourg, which was one of the finest in France,
had withdrawn to Clermont-Ferrand to continue its teaching there.
After the occupation of Alsace and since this occupation really
meant annexation, it was not reinstated in Strasbourg and remained
in its city of refuge. The Nazis expressed their great disapproval
of this in numerous threatening memoranda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We would like to submit Document Number RF-711 relative
to this. In this document we shall again come across the Ministerial
Counsellor, Herbert Kraft, about whom I spoke in the preceding
document. The document, which I submit, bears the Document
Number RF-711 and is an original signed by Kraft. It was found in
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>
the archives of the German Embassy. In this memorandum, which
is dated 4 July 1941, Counsellor Kraft expresses his disappointment
at the result of steps which he had undertaken with the Rector of
the University of Strasbourg, M. Danjon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that it is adequate if I read a very short passage of
this memorandum in order to show the insolence and the
threatening methods which the Germans used, even in the part of
France which was not yet occupied. The passage which I am going
to read will be the last paragraph on Page 2 of Document Number
RF-711. Mr. Kraft relates the end of his conversation with the
rector. I cite:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I cut off the conversation, rose, and asked him, by chance,
whether the decisions of Admiral Darlan did not represent
for him an order from his government. As I went out I
added, ‘I hope that you will be arrested.’ He ran after me,
made me repeat my remark, and called out, ironically, that
this would be a great honor for him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This document gives an amusing impression, but the matter as a
whole was very serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 15th of June 1943 the German Embassy wrote a note which
I submit as Document Number RF-712. This document is an extract
from the archives of the High Court of Justice, and has been
certified by the clerk of that jurisdiction. Here is the text of this
Document RF-712. I shall not read the beginning of the document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Embassy considers it very desirable to find a
solution of the affair of the University of Strasbourg at
Clermont-Ferrand.</p>
<hr class='tbk435'/>
<p class='noindent'>“We would be happy to learn that no further publication
would appear under the heading ‘University of Strasbourg’
so that new disagreements may not result from publications
of that kind.</p>
<hr class='tbk436'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The German Embassy has taken note of the fact that the
Ministry of National Education will no longer fill vacant
professorial chairs.</p>
<hr class='tbk437'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Furthermore, it is requested that in the future no examination
certificates be awarded under the title ‘University of
Strasbourg.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I must, in concluding this subject of the University of Strasbourg,
point out to the Tribunal a fact which is notorious, that is
that Thursday, 25 November 1943, the German police took
possession of the buildings of the University of Strasbourg in
Clermont-Ferrand, arrested the professors and students, screened
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>
them, and deported a great number of persons. During this operation,
they even shot at two professors; one was killed and the other
seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will be able to produce a document relative to this; but I
think that is not indispensable, since there are no proofs for the
Prosecution that these murders were committed under orders which
definitely show governmental responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Faure, did you say that you had or had
not got proof of the facts that you have just stated about the
seizure of the property of the university?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I said this, Mr. President: We consider that these
facts are facts of public knowledge; but because of the interpretation
which was given by the Tribunal, I have considered that
it would be better to prove it by a document. As this document
was not added to my file at that time, this document will be
submitted as an appendix. I am going to read a passage of this
document; but I should like to explain that it is not found in its
proper place, as I added it to the brief after the statement of the
Tribunal the other day on the interpretation of facts of “public
knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Court will adjourn now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tomorrow being Saturday, the Tribunal will sit from 10 o’clock
in the morning until 1 o’clock. We will then adjourn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: It was said that this afternoon there will be
a witness. I would like to ask that this testimony be postponed to
another day. I believe that we have reached a so-called silent
agreement that we shall be notified in advance as to whether
there will be witnesses and what the subject of their evidence
will be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know whether there will be cross-examination; but
the possibility exists, of course, and pertinent questions can only be
put when we know, first of all, who the witness is to be, and
secondly, what the subject will be on which the witness is to be
cross-examined, perhaps just a clue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not think it is necessary
to postpone the evidence of this witness. As a matter of courtesy
on the part of the Prosecution, it would be well, perhaps, but the
subject matter—not necessarily the name, but the subject matter
upon which the witness is to give evidence—should be communicated
to the Defense so that they may prepare themselves upon
that subject matter for any cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I understand that this afternoon you propose to call a witness
who will deal with the circumstances in respect to the German
occupation of Luxembourg. That is right, is it not?
<span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps you will give the defendants’ counsel
the subject matter upon which they can prepare themselves for
cross-examination. I am told that this subject matter has already
been communicated to the defendants and is on their bulletin board
at the present moment.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
the Defendants Kaltenbrunner, Seyss-Inquart, and Streicher will be
absent from this afternoon’s session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The question which was raised this morning
about certain documents has been investigated, and the Tribunal
understands that the documents were placed in the Defense Counsel’s
Information Center yesterday; but it may be that the misunderstanding
arose owing to those documents not having been in
any way indexed, and it would, I think, be very helpful to the
Defense Counsel if Prosecuting Counsel could, with the documents,
deposit also some sort of index which would enable the Defense
Counsel to find the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: It is understood that we shall present a table of
contents of the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think if you could, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Your Honors, I was speaking this morning of the
incident which occurred at the Strasbourg faculty in Clermont-Ferrand,
on 25 November 1943. I pointed out to the Tribunal that
I shall produce to this effect a document. This document has not
been classified in the document book, and I shall ask the Tribunal
to accept it as an annex number or as the last document of this
book, if that is agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a report of M. Hoeppfner, Dean of the Faculty of Letters,
established on 8 January 1946, and transmitted from Lorraine to the
French Prosecution. I should like simply to read to the Tribunal,
in order not to take up too much of its time, the two passages which
constitute the texts which were submitted to it as an appendix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got the original document here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is the 25th of November 1943, a Thursday. The 10 o’clock
class is drawing to an end. As I come out of the room, a
student posted at a window in the hall signals me to approach
and shows me in the inner court in front of the Department
of Physics a Wehrmacht soldier with helmet, boots, a submachine
gun in his arm, mounting guard. ‘Let us try to flee.’
Too late. At the same moment, wild cries arise from all directions—the
corridors, the stairways are filled with the sound
of heavy boots, the clanking of weapons, fierce cries, a frantic
shuffling. A soldier rushes down the hall shouting, ‘Everybody
in the courtyard—tell the others.’ Naturally, everyone
understood.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Second passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“One of our people, Paul Collomp, was cold-bloodedly murdered
with a shot in the chest, and an eyewitness confirms
the fact. Alas, it is only too true. Asked to leave the Secretariat
where he was, Collomp no doubt obeyed too slowly to
suit the policeman, for the latter gave him a violent blow on
the back; instinctively, our colleague turned around, and the
other then fired a shot directly into his chest. Death was
almost immediate, but the body was left lying there alone
until that evening. Another rumor reached us. We didn’t
know from where. A colleague in Protestant Theology,
M. Eppel, was apparently also shot down, in his own house,
where they had gone to look for him. He received, as was
later learned, several bullet shots in the abdomen but miraculously
recovered and even survived the horrors of Buchenwald
Camp.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As I indicated to the Tribunal this morning, I wish to say that
the Prosecution has no proof that such crimes were due to a German
governmental order; but I believe that it is nevertheless interesting
to advise the Tribunal of this last episode in the German undertakings
against the University of Strasbourg, for the episode constitutes
the sequel and, in a sense, the climax of the preceding
incidents. We have seen, indeed, that German procedure began at
first regularly and that after these regular procedures it reached the
stage of recourse to the police. Brutality and violation accompanied
this recourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to advise you that this document which I have just read
bears the Document Number RF-712 (bis).</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now to the second part of this subject, which is the
imposition of German standards. The leaders of the Reich began
by organizing a specifically German administration. I already
indicated a while ago the appointment of Gauleiter as heads of the
civil administration. I continue on this point by producing as Document
Number RF-713 the Ordinance of 28 August 1940, <span class='it'>Official
Gazette</span> of the Reich, 1940, Page 22. The Ordinance is entitled:
“Concerning the Introduction of the German Regime in Alsace.”
I shall not read this Ordinance. I simply indicate that its object is
to put into effect, from 1 October 1940 on, the German municipal
regime of 30 January 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The text and the organization show that the territories annexed
were reorganized on the basis of German administrative concepts.
At the head of each district (arrondissement) we no longer have
a French subprefect but a Landkommissar, who has under his orders
the different offices of Finance, Labor, School Inspection, Commerce,
and Health. The large towns, the chief towns of arrondissements
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>
and even of cantons, were endowed with a Stadtkommissar instead
of, and replacing, the mayors and elected counsellors, who had been
eliminated. The judicial offices were attached to the court of appeals
in Karlsruhe. The economic departments and, in particular, the
chambers of commerce were run by the representatives of the
chambers of commerce of Karlsruhe for Alsace and of Saarbrücken
for Moselle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having germanized the forms of administrative activity,
the Germans undertook to germanize the staffs. They nominated
numerous German officials to posts of authority. They attempted,
moreover, on a number of occasions, to make the officials who had
remained in office sign declarations of loyalty to the Germans.
These attempts, however, met with a refusal from the officials.
They were therefore renewed on a number of occasions in different
forms. We have recovered from the archives of the Gauleiter of
Strasbourg 8 or 10 different formulas for these declarations of
loyalty. I shall produce one of these for the Tribunal, by way of
example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is Document Number RF-714. It is the formula for the new
declaration which the officials are obliged to sign if they wish to
retain their positions:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Name and first name, grade and service, residence.</p>
<hr class='tbk438'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have been employed from —— 1940 to this date
in the public service of the German administration in Alsace.
During this period I have had, from my own observation as
well as from the Party and the authorities, verbally and in
writing, occasion to learn the obligations of a German official
and the requirements which are exacted of him from a political
and ideological point of view. I approve these obligations
and these requirements without reservation and am
resolved to be ruled by them in my personal and professional
life. I affirm my adherence to the German people and to the
National Socialist ideals of Adolf Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Along with the administration, properly speaking, the Nazis set
up in Alsace the parallel administration of the National Socialist
Party, as well as that of the Arbeitsfront, which was the sole labor
organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>German currency legislation was introduced in Alsace on 19 October
and in Lorraine on 25 October 1940. The Reichsmark became
thenceforth the legal means of payment in the annexed territory.
The German judicial organization was introduced by a series of
successive measures leading up to the decree of 30 September 1941
concerning the simplification of the judicial organization in Alsace.
I produce this ordinance as Document Number RF-715, without
reading it.
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In regard to the teaching system, the German authorities
established a series of regulations and ordinances which were
aimed at assuring the unification of the Alsatian school system
with the German teaching system. I shall simply mention the dates
of the principal texts, which we produce as documents, and which
are of a public nature, since they were all published in the <span class='it'>Official
Gazette</span> of the Reich in Alsace. Here are the main texts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-717, regulation of 2 October 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-718, ordinance of 24 March 1941 on elementary
teaching in Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-719, ordinance of 21 April 1941 concerning
the allocation of subsidies for education in Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-720, ordinance of 11 June 1941 on obligatory
education in Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now quote a series of measures ordering the introduction in
Alsace and Lorraine of German civil law, German criminal law, and
even procedure. I shall quote as the most important, under Document
Number RF-721, the ordinance of 19 June 1941 concerning the
application of the provisions of German legislation to Alsatians.
I should like to read the first paragraph of Article 1 because it contains
an interesting item:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1:</p>
<hr class='tbk439'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The legal relationships of persons who acquired French
citizenship under the Appendix to Articles 51 to 79 of the
Versailles dictate and of those who derive their nationality
from those persons, in particular in the domain of personal
and family law, are governed by the legislation in force in
the former Empire, in accordance with the law of the country
of origin, insofar as this legislation applies to the country of
origin.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A similar ordinance was drawn up for Lorraine, Document Number
RF-722, ordinance of 15 September 1941 concerning the application
of German legislation to personal and family status in
Lorraine. <span class='it'>Official Bulletin</span> of the Reich, Page 817.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to quote, indicating the titles and references, the
principal measures which have been introduced in penal matters:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-723, notice of 14 February 1941 relative
to the penal dispositions declared applicable in Lorraine by virtue
of Section 1 of the second ordinance concerning certain transitory
measures in the domain of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-724, ordinance of 29 October 1941 relative
to the introduction into Alsace of the German legislation of penal
procedure and of other penal laws.
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-725, ordinance of 30 January 1942 relative
to the introduction into Alsace of the German penal code and
other penal laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not wish to read this text which is long, but I should like
to draw the attention of the Tribunal to two features which show
that the Germans introduced into Alsace the most extraordinary
provisions of their penal law, conceived from the point of view of
the National Socialist regime. The Tribunal will thus see, in this
Document Number RF-725, Page 1 under Number 6 of the enumeration,
that the law of 20 December 1934, repressing perfidious attacks
directed against the State and the Party and protecting Party uniforms,
was introduced into Alsace, as well as the ordinance of
25 November 1939, under Number 11 of the enumeration, completing
the penal provisions relating to the protection of the military power
of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As concerns public freedom, the Germans eliminated from the
beginning the right of association; and they dissolved all existing
associations. They intended to leave free room for the Nazi system,
which was to be the only and obligatory association.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall quote in the same way a number of documents, with the
titles of these public texts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-726, regulation of 16 August 1940, dissolving
the youth organizations in Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-727, regulation of 22 August 1940, setting
up a supervising commission for associations in Lorraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-728, regulation of 3 September 1940, providing
for the dissolution of teachers’ unions. I point out, in regard
to this Document RF-728, that the last article provides an exception
in favor of the organization called “Union of National Socialist
Teachers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-729, regulation of 3 September 1940,
providing for the dissolution of gymnastic societies and of sports
associations in Alsace. I should like to read Article 4 of this Document
RF-729:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Commissioner of Physical Culture will take, in regard
to other gymnastic societies and sports associations in Alsace,
all necessary provisions in view of their re-integration into
the Reich’s National Socialist Union for Physical Culture.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Following up these measures of Germanization, we now encounter
two texts which are very characteristic and which I produce as
Documents Numbers RF-730 and RF-731. Of Document Number
RF-730 I read simply the title, which is significant: “Ordinance
of 7 February 1942 Relative to the Creation of an Office of the
Upper Rhine for Genealogical Research.” I shall likewise read the
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span>
title of Document Number RF-731, “Regulation of 17 February 1942
Concerning the Creation of the Department of the Reich Commission
for the Strengthening of Germanism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I indicated a moment ago to the Tribunal that the Party had
been established in Alsace and in Lorraine in a way that was
parallel with the administration in Germany. I shall produce in this
connection Document Number RF-732, which is a confidential note
of the National Socialist Workers Party of the province of Baden
dated Strasbourg, 5 March 1942. This document belongs likewise to
the series found in the files of the Gauleitung of Strasbourg. It
bears as a heading, “Gaudirektion—Auxiliary Bureau of Strasbourg.”
If it please the Tribunal, I shall read the beginning of this
document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Evaluation of recruiting possibilities of the Party, its subdivisions
and related groups in Alsace.</p>
<hr class='tbk440'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In the framework of the drive of 19 June organized for the
recruiting of party members, the Kreisleiter in collaboration
with the Ortsgruppenleiter have to investigate Alsatians
above the age of 18, even if their membership is not yet
to be obtained within this drive which may be”—the
word “which” was omitted in the text—“considered for prospective
membership of the Party, its sections, and affiliated
organizations and which men between the age of 17 and 48
could be actively employed in the Party or in its subdivisions.
In order to gain a numerical survey, these investigations
should also comprise all persons already enrolled in the
Party, in the Opferring”—this is the collecting organization
of the Party—“in the sections, and affiliated organizations.</p>
<hr class='tbk441'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Kreisleiter may call upon the collaboration of the Kreisorganisationsleiter”—these
are the organizing directors of the
section—“and of the Kreispersonalamtsleiter”—the personnel
information offices of the sections—“In spite of this work the
19 June drive for recruiting members should not suffer but
must be carried on by all possible means and gain the goal
set by the Gauleiter at the given date.</p>
<hr class='tbk442'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The results of the screening of the population are to be
compiled in five lists, namely: List 1a; List 1b; List 2a;
List 2b; Control list.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall skip over the following paragraphs, which are rather long
and purely administrative, and I shall continue on Page 2 of the
document, Paragraph 9:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since it is the aim of the National Socialist movement to
embrace all Germans in a National Socialist organization in
order to mould and direct them in compliance with the intentions
of the Movement, 90 percent of the population will have
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>
to figure on Lists 1a and b and 2a and b, while on the Control
List only those shall be named who, on account of racial
inferiority or asocial or anti-German attitude are considered
unworthy of belonging to an organization, are not deemed
worthy of membership in Party organizations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now enter upon the two most serious questions which are
directly interconnected, questions which, on the one hand, concern
nationality and, on the other hand, military recruiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German policy in the matter of nationality reveals a certain
hesitation, which is related to the German policy in regard to military
recruiting. Indeed, the German leaders seem to have been
swayed by two contradictory trends. One of these trends was that
of bestowing the German nationality on a large number of people,
in order to impose the corresponding obligation for military service.
The other trend was that of conferring nationality only with discrimination.
According to this viewpoint it was considered, first of
all, that the possession of nationality was an honor and should to
some extent constitute a reward when conferred on those who had
not previously possessed it. On the other hand, nationality confers
on its possessor a certain special quality. In spite of the abolition
of all democracy, it gives that person a certain influence in the
German community. It should, therefore, be granted only to persons
who give guarantees in certain regards, notably that of loyalty;
and we know that, from the German point of view, loyalty is not
only a matter of mental attitude and choice but that it also applies
to certain well-known physical elements, such as those of blood,
race, and origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are the two opposed trends in the German policy of conferring
nationality. This is how they develop:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first—and up to the month of August 1942—the Reich, not
yet requiring soldiers as urgently as it did later, deferred the introduction
of compulsory recruiting. Along with this they also deferred
any action to impose German nationality on the population generally.
During this earlier period the Nazis did not resort to compulsory
recruiting but relied simply on voluntary recruiting which,
however, they tried to render more effective by offering all kinds
of inducements and exercising pressure in various ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not go into details regarding these German procedures
for voluntary recruitment. I should like simply to give, by way of
example, the subject matter of Document Number RF-733. It is an
appeal posted in Alsace on 15 January 1942 and constitutes one of
the appendices of the governmental report, which was submitted
previously under Document Number UK-72. In this document, I
shall read simply the first sentence of the second paragraph:
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Alsatians: Since the beginning of the campaign in the East,
hundreds of Alsatians have freely decided to march as volunteers,
side by side with the men of the other German regions,
against the enemy of civilization and European culture.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>For anyone who knows German propaganda and its technique
of exaggeration, the term “hundreds” which is used in this document
immediately betrays the failure of the Nazi recruiters.
“Hundreds” may obviously be translated by “tens,” and it must be
admitted that this was a very poor supply for the Wehrmacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the period that I am speaking of the Nazis practiced, in
regard to nationality, a policy similar to their policy in recruiting
military forces, that is, a policy of selective nationalization. They
appealed for volunteers for German nationality. It is desirable to
quote in this regard an ordinance of 20 January 1942, a general
ordinance of the Reich, not a special one for the annexed territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ordinance in its first article increases the possibilities of
naturalization, which until then had been extremely limited, in
accordance with the Reich statute book. In Article 3 it gives the
following provision: (This ordinance is not produced in the document
book, for it is an ordinance of the German Reich and, therefore,
a public document.)</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister of the Interior may, by means of a general
regulation, grant German nationality to categories of
foreigners established on a territory placed under the sovereign
power of Germany or having their origin in such territory.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with this earlier period it is necessary to stress
that natives of Alsace-Lorraine who did not become German
citizens did not retain their French nationality. They are all
considered as German subjects. They are qualified in the documents
of the period as “members of the German community
(Volksdeutsch),” and are consequently liable for German labor
service. I submit Document Number RF-734 in this connection,
“Regulation of 27 August 1942, on Compulsory Military Service
and on Labor Service in Alsace.” I shall return to this document
presently with regard to military service, but I would like to quote
now the passages relative to service in the Hitler Youth, one of
which bears an earlier date, the ordinance of 2 January 1942 for
Alsace and ordinance of 4 August 1942 for Lorraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German policy regarding nationality and military recruiting
reaches its turning point in the month of August 1942. At this
moment, on account of military difficulties and the need for
extensive recruiting, the Germans instituted compulsory military
service in Lorraine by an ordinance of 19 August 1942 and in
Alsace by an ordinance of 25 August 1942. These two ordinances,
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>
relative to the introduction of compulsory military service, constitute
Document Number RF-735, ordinance for Lorraine, and
Document Number RF-736, ordinance for Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, the Germans promulgated an ordinance of
23 August 1942 on German nationality in Alsace, Lorraine, and
Luxembourg. This text is the subject of a circular issued by the
Reich Minister of the Interior, which constitutes Document Number
RF-737. These provisions are the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Full rights of nationality are acquired by natives of Alsace
and Lorraine and Luxembourgers of German origin:</p>
<hr class='tbk443'/>
<p class='noindent'>“When they have been or will be called upon to serve in the
armed forces of the Reich or in SS armed formations;</p>
<hr class='tbk444'/>
<p class='noindent'>“when they are recognized as having acted as good Germans.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As concerns the expression “of German origin,” which is used
in these texts, this concerns Alsatians and Lorrainers who have
become French either through the Treaty of Versailles or subsequently
on condition of having previously been German nationals
or having transferred their domicile from Alsace or Lorraine to
the territory of the Reich after 1 September 1939; and, finally,
children, grandchildren, and spouses of the preceding categories of
persons are likewise considered as of German origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly, it was anticipated that the Alsatians, Lorrainers, and
Luxembourgers who did not acquire German nationality absolutely
could obtain it provisionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to mention, to complete this question of nationality,
that an ordinance of 2 February 1943 gave details as to the German
nationality laws applicable in Alsace, and that an ordinance of
2 November 1943 likewise conferred German nationality upon
persons who had been in concentration camps during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German texts indicate that, on the one hand, German
nationality was imposed upon a great number of persons; and, on
the other hand, that Alsatians and Lorrainers who were French
were forced to comply with the exorbitant and truly criminal
requirements of military service in the German Army against
their own country. These military obligations were constantly
extended by the calling-up of successive classes, as far as the 1908
class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These German exigencies provoked a solemn protest on the part
of the French National Committee, which in London represented
the Free French Government authority. I should like to read to
the Tribunal the text of this protest, which is dated 16 September
1942, and which I submit as Exhibit Number RF-739. I shall read
only the three paragraphs of the official protest, which constitute
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>
the beginning of this document of the Information Agency in
London.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“After having proclaimed, in the course of the war, the
annexation of Alsace and of Lorraine, banished and robbed
a great number of the inhabitants, and enforced the most
rigorous measures of Germanization, the Reich now constrains
Alsatians and Lorrainers—declared German by the Reich—to
serve in the German armies against their own compatriots
and against the allies of France.</p>
<hr class='tbk445'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The National Committee, defender of the integrity and of
the unity of France and trustee of the principle of the rights
of peoples, protests, in the face of the civilized world, against
these new crimes committed in contempt of international
conventions against the will of populations ardently attached
to France. It proclaims inviolable the right of Alsatians and
of Lorrainers to remain members of the French family.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This protest could not have been unknown to the Germans, for
it was read and commented on over the radio by the French
National Commissioner of Justice, Professor René Cassin, on a
number of occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In regard to this solemn protest on the part of France, I shall
allow myself to quote the justifications, if one may use this term,
which were furnished in a speech by Gauleiter Wagner delivered
in Colmar on 20 June 1943. This quotation is drawn from the
<span class='it'>Mühlhäuser Tageblatt</span> of 21 June 1943. In view of its importance
I shall not deal with it simply as a quotation, but I produce it as
a document and submit it as Document Number RF-740. The clerk
has been given this paper. I read the explanations of Gauleiter
Wagner, as they are reproduced in this newspaper under the title
“Alsace will not Stand Aloof”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The decisive event for Alsace in 1942 was therefore the
introduction of compulsory military service. It cannot be my
intention to justify legally a measure which strikes so deeply
at the life of Alsace. There is no reason for this either. Every
decision which the Greater Reich is taking, here is motivated
and cannot be attacked as to its juridical and its <span class='it'>de facto</span>
form.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, the Alsatians and Lorrainers refused to accept the
criminal orders of the German authorities, and they undertook to
avoid these by every means. The Nazis then decided to compel
them by means of merciless measures. The frontiers were strictly
guarded, and the guards had orders to fire on the numerous
recalcitrants who attempted to escape across the border. I should
like to quote in this connection a sentence from a newspaper
article, which appeared in the <span class='it'>Dernières Nouvelles de Strasbourg</span>
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>
of 28 August 1942. This is Document Number RF-741. This
article deals with the death of one of these men who refused to
serve in the German Army, and it concludes with the following
sentence: “We insist most particularly on the fact that it is suicidal
to attempt to cross the frontier illegally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, judicial penalties were applied with great severity
and in a large number of cases. I do not consider that I should
bring to the Tribunal all the instances of these cases, which would
take too long; but I should like simply to insist on the principle that
governed this form of repression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall quote first of all a document which is entirely characteristic
of the conception which the German administration had
of justice and of the independence of judicial power. This is
Document Number RF-742. It is a part of a series of documents
discovered in the files of the Gauleitung. It is a teletype message
dated Strasbourg, 8 June 1944, addressed by Gauleiter Wagner
to the Chief of the Court of Appeals in Karlsruhe. I shall read
Paragraph 2 of this document, which is on Page 1 of the same
document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Especially in Alsace it is required that the sentences for
refusal of military service should be intimidating. But upon
those trying to evade military service, for fear of personal
danger, this intimidating effect can be produced only by the
death penalty, the more so, as an Alsatian bent upon escaping
military service by emigration counts generally on an early
victory of the enemy and, therefore, in case of conviction
with punishment other than death, with a near cancellation
of the penalty. The death penalty is, therefore, to be applied
in all cases in which after 6 June 1944 an evasion of military
service is attempted by illegal emigration, irrespectively
of any other legal practice used in Germany proper.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But I wish to indicate that the consideration of personal risk,
even that of being killed at the frontier or condemned to death,
was not sufficient to make the people of Alsace and Lorraine
acknowledge the obligation for military service. Thus the Nazis
decided to have recourse to the only threat which could be effective,
the threat of reprisals against families. After 4 September 1942,
there appeared in the <span class='it'>Dernières Nouvelles de Strasbourg</span> a notice
entitled “Severe Sanctions Against Those Who Fail to Appear
Before the Revision Council.” An extract from this notice constitutes
Document Number RF-743. I shall read from it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the case mentioned above it has been shown that parents
have not given proof of authority in this regard. They have
thus proved that they do not yet understand the requirements
of the present time, which can tolerate in Alsace only reliable
<span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span>
persons. The parents of the above-named young men will
therefore shortly be deported to the Aleichem in order to
re-acquire, in a National Socialist atmosphere, an attitude in
conformity with the German spirit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus the deportation of families was decreed, not to punish a
definite insubordination, but to punish failure to appear before
the recruiting board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to avoid repeated readings, I shall now present to the
Tribunal, under the heading of Document Number RF-744, the
ordinance of 1 October 1943, to check failure to perform military
service (<span class='it'>Official Bulletin</span> of the Reich for 1943, Page 152). I shall
read the first two articles:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article 1: The chief of the civil administration in Alsace may
deny residence in Alsace to deserters and to persons who fail
to fulfill their military obligations or those of the compulsory
labor service, as well as to members of their families. This
prohibition entails, for persons of German origin whom it
may affect, transplantation to Reich territory by the
Plenipotentiary for the Reich, Reich Commissioner for the
Preservation of German Nationality. Measures to be taken in
regard to property, seizure, indemnity, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, are prescribed
in the ordinance of 2 February 1943, concerning
property measures to be applied in the case of persons of
German origin transferred from Alsace to Reich territory.</p>
<hr class='tbk446'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph 2: Independently of the preceding measures,
criminal proceedings may be instituted under the penal code
for violation of the provisions of the penal laws.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Exactly what did “souche allemande” mean?
How far did it go?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The term “souche allemande” applies, as indicated
in connection with the preceding text, to the following categories
of persons: In the first place, persons who were in Alsace and
Lorraine before the Treaty of Versailles and who became French
by the treaty; persons whose nationality before 1919 was German
are considered as of German origin, as well as their children, their
grandchildren, and their spouses. This affects the great majority of
the population of the three departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continue reading Paragraph 2 of the first article of Document
Number RF-744.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Independently of the foregoing measures, penal prosecutions
may be brought for violation of the provisions of the penal
laws.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>According to Article 52, Paragraph 2, of the Reich Penal Code,
members of the family who bring proof of their genuine efforts to
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>
prevent or dissuade the fugitive from committing his act or avoiding
the necessity of flight shall not be punishable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These abominable measures, the obligation of denunciation,
punishment inflicted upon families, permitted the German
authorities to carry out the enlistment of Alsatians and Lorrainers,
which for many of them had fatal consequences and which was for
all of them a particularly tragic ordeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must finally indicate, to conclude this part, that the Germans
proceeded to the mobilization of women for war work. I produce a
Document Number RF-745, the ordinance of 26 January 1942,
completing the war organization of labor service for the young
women of Lorraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we find an ordinance of 2 February 1943, Document
Number RF-746, concerning the declaration of men and women for
the accomplishment of tasks pertaining to national defense. (<span class='it'>Official
Bulletin</span> of the Reich, 1943, Page 26.) This ordinance concerns
Alsace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following Document, Number RF-747, deals with Lorraine.
This is an ordinance of 8 February 1943 concerning the enrollment
of men and women for tasks relating to the organization of labor.
The Tribunal will note that the ordinance concerning Alsace used
the expression “tasks of interest to national defense,” whereas
the ordinance relative to Lorraine specifies simply “tasks concerning
the organization of labor”; but in principle these are the same.
Article 1 of this second ordinance, Document Number RF-747,
refers to the ordinance of the General Delegate for the Organization
of Labor, relative to the declaration of men and women for tasks
of interest to national defense, et cetera. This is a question of
making not only men, but also women, work for the German
war effort. I shall read for the Tribunal an extract from a newspaper
article which comments on this legislation and likewise on
the measures which Gauleiter Wagner proposed to undertake in
this connection. This constitutes Document Number RF-748, taken
from the newspaper <span class='it'>Dernières Nouvelles de Strasbourg</span>, dated
23 February 1943.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In his speech at Karlsruhe Gauleiter Robert Wagner stressed
that measures of total mobilization would be applied to
Alsace and that the authorities would abstain from any
bureaucratic working method. The Alsatian labor offices have
already invited the first category of young women liable
for mobilization to fill out the enlistment form.</p>
<hr class='tbk447'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In principle, all women who until the present have worked
only at home, who have had to care only for their husbands,
and who have no other relatives, shall work a full day.
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>
Many married men who until now had never offered to help
their wives with the household work will be obliged to put
their shoulder to the wheel. They will work in the household
and do errands. With a little goodwill, everything will work
out. Women who have received a professional education
shall be put, if possible, to tasks that relate to their professions,
on condition that they have an important bearing
on the war effort. This prescription applies only to all
feminine professions which imply care given to other
persons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here again a rather comical or clumsily worded presentation
should not prevent one from perceiving the odious character of
these measures, which obliged French women to work for the
German war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for ten minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. Dodd would like to speak to the Tribunal
concerning a question he wishes to put to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, I ask to be heard briefly to inform
the Tribunal that the affiant Andreas Pfaffenberger, whom the
Tribunal directed the Prosecution for the United States to locate,
if possible, was located yesterday and he is here in Nuremberg
today. He is available for the cross-examination which, if I
remember correctly, was requested by Counsel for the Defendant
Kaltenbrunner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was his affidavit read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, Your Honor, it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It was read, and on the condition that he
should be brought here for cross-examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, Sir. He asked for him to be brought, if I
recall it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does counsel for Kaltenbrunner wish to
cross-examine him now—I mean, not this moment—does he still
wish to cross-examine him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I believe that the Defendant Kaltenbrunner
does not need the testimony of this witness. However, I would
have to take this question up with him once more, for up till
today it was not certain that Pfaffenberger would be in court, and
if he is to be cross-examined and to testify, I believe Kaltenbrunner
would have to be present at the hearing.
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It seems somewhat unfortunate that the
witness should be brought here for cross-examination and that then
you should be saying that you don’t want to cross-examine him
after reading the affidavit. It seems to me that the reasonable
thing to do would be to make up your mind whether you do, or
do not, want to cross-examine him; and I should have thought that
would have been done and he would have been brought here, if
you want to cross-examine, and not brought here if you did not
want to cross-examine. Anyway, as he has been brought here now,
it seems to me that if you want to cross-examine him you must
do so. Mr. Dodd, can he be kept here for some time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: He can, Your Honor, except that he was in a
concentration camp for 6 years; and we have to keep him here
under certain security, and it is somewhat of a hardship on him
to be kept too long. We would like not to keep him any longer
than necessary. We located him with some difficulty with the help
of the United States Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: In perhaps 2 or 3 days we might wish to
cross-examine; perhaps two or three days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I imagine that if after the affidavit had been
read that you demanded to cross-examine him and that he has
therefore been produced—well, in those circumstances it seems to me
unreasonable that you should ask that he should now be kept for
2 or 3 days when he is produced. Mr. Dodd, would it be possible
to keep him here until Monday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, he can be kept here until Monday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will keep him here until Monday, and
you can cross-examine as you wish, Dr. Kauffmann. You understand
what I mean; when an affidavit has been put in and one of the
Defense Counsel said that he wants to cross-examine, he ought to
inform the Prosecution if, after reading and considering the affidavit,
he finds that he does not want to cross-examine him; they ought
to inform the Prosecution so as to avoid all the cost and trouble of
bringing a witness from some distance off. Do you follow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I will proceed with the cross-examination
on Monday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, I would ask the Tribunal whether
they would agree to hear the witness Emil Reuter at this point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Emil Reuter, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is your name?
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>EMIL REUTER (Witness): Reuter, Emil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Emil Reuter, do you swear to speak without
hate or fear, to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in French.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Raise the right hand and say, “I swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Reuter, you are a lawyer of the Luxembourg Bar?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: You are President of the Chamber of Deputies of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: You had been exercising these functions at the time
of the invasion of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by the German
troops?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you give us any indication on the fact that the
Government of the Reich had, a few days before the invasion of
Luxembourg, given to the Government of the Grand Duchy assurances
of their peaceful intentions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: In August 1939 the German Minister for Luxembourg
gave to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the country a statement
according to which the German Reich, in the event of a European
war, would respect the independence and neutrality of the country,
provided that Luxembourg would not violate its own neutrality.
A few days before the invasion, in May 1940, the Germans constructed
pontoon bridges over half of the Moselle River which
separates the two countries. An explanation from the German
Minister in Luxembourg represented such construction of pontoon
bridges as landing stages in the interest of navigation. In the general
public opinion of the country, these installations were really of a
military character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you tell us about the situation of public authorities
in Luxembourg following the departure of Her Royal Highness,
the Grand Duchess, and of her government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: The continuity of administration in the country was
assured by a government commission which possessed the necessary
powers bestowed upon it by the competent constitutional authorities.
There was, therefore, no lack of authority in the administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Is it not true, however, that the Germans claimed,
upon their arrival in that country, that the government had failed
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>
to carry out its functions; and, following the departure of the
government, that there was no regular authority in the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Yes, such declaration was made by the Ministers of
the Reich in Luxembourg before a Parliamentary Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Do I understand correctly that these statements on
the part of the German authorities did not in fact correspond to the
truth inasmuch as you have told us that there did exist a higher
organism for the administration of the country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: This statement did not correspond to the reality. It
was obviously aimed at usurping authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Reuter, the Germans never proclaimed by law the
annexation of Luxembourg. Do you consider that the measures
adopted by the Germans in that country were equivalent to
annexation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: The measures that were taken by the Germans in the
Grand Duchy were obviously equivalent to a <span class='it'>de facto</span> annexation of
that country. Shortly after the invasion the leaders of the Reich in
Luxembourg stated in public and official speeches that the annexation
by law would occur at a time which would be freely selected by the
Führer. The proof of this <span class='it'>de facto</span> annexation is shown in a clear
manner by the whole series of ordinances which the Germans
published in the Grand Duchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The Germans organized an operation which was
called a census in Luxembourg. In the form that was given the
inhabitants of Luxembourg to effect the census, there was one
question concerning the native or usual language and another
question as to the racial background of the individual. Are you
prepared to assert that in view of these two questions this census
was considered as having the character of a plebiscite, a political
character?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: From the menacing instructions published by the
German authorities in connection with this census, the political purpose
was obvious; therefore public opinion never envisaged this
census except as a sort of attempt to achieve a plebiscite camouflaged
as a census, a political operation destined to give a certain
justification to the annexation which was to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The report of the Luxembourg Government does not
give any indication of the statistical results of this census, specifically
with regard to the political question of which I spoke a
moment ago. Would you be kind enough to tell us why these statistical
data are not to be found in any document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: The complete statistical data have never been collected
because after a partial examination of the first results the German
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>
authorities noted that only an infinitesimal fraction of the population
had answered the two tricky questions in the German sense. The
German authorities then preferred to stop the operation, and the
forms distributed in the country for obtaining the answers were
never collected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Do you remember the date of the census?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: This census must have taken place in 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: After the census the Germans realized that there
was no majority, and not even any considerable part of the
population which was desirous of being incorporated into the
German Reich. However, did they continue to apply their measures
of annexation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Measures tending to Germanization and later to the
annexation of the country were continued, and later on they were
even reinforced by further new measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Am I to understand, therefore, that during the
application of these measures the Germans could not be ignorant
of the fact that the Luxembourg population was opposed to them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: There can be no doubt at all on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you tell us whether it is correct that the German
authorities obliged members of the constabulary force and the police
to take an oath of allegiance to the Chancellor of the Reich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Yes. This was forced upon the constabulary corps and
the police with very serious threats and punishments. Recalcitrants
were usually deported, if I remember rightly, to Sachsenhausen;
and on the approach of the Russian Army all or a part of the recalcitrants
who were in the camp were shot. There were about
150 of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you tell us anything concerning the transfer—I
believe the Germans call it “Umsiedlung”—of a certain number
of inhabitants and families living in your country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: The transplanting was ordered by the German
authority of Luxembourg for elements which appeared to be unfit
for assimilation or unworthy of, or undesirable for, residence on the
frontiers of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you indicate the approximate number of people
who were victims of this transplanting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: There must have been about 7,000 people who were
transplanted in this manner, because we found in Luxembourg a list
mentioning between 2,800 and 2,900 homes or families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: These indications are based on knowledge you received
as President of the Chamber of Deputies?
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Not exactly, the list was found in Luxembourg; it is
still deposited there and the Office of War Criminals took cognizance
of it, like all the judicial authorities in Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you state, M. Reuter, how the people who were
transplanted were informed of this measure concerning them, and
how much time they had to be ready?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: In general, the families to be transplanted were not
given notice in advance, officially, at least. About 6 o’clock in the
morning the Gestapo rang at the door, and they notified those who
were selected to be ready for departure within 1 or 2 hours with
a minimum of luggage. Then they were taken to the station and
put on a train for the camp to which they were at first to be sent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you tell us whether these measures were applied
to people whom you know personally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: I know personally a very large number of people who
were transplanted, among them members of my own family, a great
number of colleagues of the Chamber of Deputies, many members
of the Bar, many magistrates, and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: In addition to these transplantations, were there also
deportations to concentration camps? This is another question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: Yes, there were deportations to concentration camps
which everyone knew about. The number of such deportations in
the Grand Duchy may be approximately four thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Reuter, it has been established, through their
ordinances, that the German authorities prescribed compulsory
military service. I will not ask you, therefore, any question on this
particular point. However, I would like to ask you whether you
are able to state, approximately, the number of Luxembourg citizens
who were enrolled in the German Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: The young people who were incorporated into the
German Army by force belonged to 5 classes, beginning with the
class of 1920. The number is about eleven thousand to twelve
thousand, at least. A certain number of them, I think about one-third,
succeeded in avoiding conscription and became refractory.
Others later deserted the German Army and fled to other countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you indicate the approximate number of Luxembourgers
who died as a result of their forced enlistment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: At the end of September 1944 we had 2,500 dead.
Searches have continued and at present I think we have established
the names of at least 3,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The sanctions that had been provided to force the
enlistment of the Luxembourgers, were they very severe?
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: These sanctions were extremely severe. First of all,
the young people who were refractory were pursued and hunted
by the police and by the Gestapo. Then they were brought before
various types of Tribunals, in Luxembourg, France, Belgium, or
Germany. Their families were deported; the family fortune was
generally confiscated. The penalties pronounced by the Tribunals
against these young people were very severe. The death penalty
was general, or else imprisonment, forced labor, or deportation to
concentration camps. Some of them were released later on, but
there were some who were shot as hostages after having been
released.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I would like to ask one last question. Do you think
it is possible that the measures which constituted a <span class='it'>de facto</span>
annexation of Luxembourg could have been unknown to the persons
who belonged to the Reich Government, or to the German High
Command?</p>

<p class='pindent'>REUTER: I believe that it is hardly possible that such a situation
could have been unknown to the members of the Reich and the
supreme military authority. My opinion is based on the following
facts: First of all, our young people, when mobilized by force,
frequently protested at the time of their arrival in Germany by
invoking the fact that they were all of Luxembourg nationality, and
that they were the victims of force, so that the military authorities
must have been informed of the situation in the Grand Duchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second place, several Ministers of the Reich—among them,
Thierack, Rust, and Ley—visited the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,
and could see for themselves the situation of the country and the
reaction of the population; other high political personalities of the
Reich, such as Bormann and Sauckel, also paid visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally there were German decrees and ordinances concerning
the denationalization of certain categories of Luxembourg citizens.
These ordinances bore the signature of the Minister of the Reich.
The executive measures implementing these ordinances were published
in the <span class='it'>Official Gazette of the Reich Ministry of the Interior</span>
under the signature of the Minister of Interior Frick with the
indication that these instructions were to be communicated to all
the superior Reich authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I thank you. Those are all the questions I have to
put to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The American, British and Russian prosecutors had no questions.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there any member of the defendants’
counsel who wishes to ask the witness any questions? [<span class='it'>No response.</span>]
Then M. Faure the witness can retire.
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, am I to understand that the witness
will not have to remain any longer at the disposal of the Tribunal
and he may return to his home?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I had stopped my presentation at the end of the
second part. That is to say, I have examined so far, in the first
place, the elimination of the French regime and secondly, the
imposition of German rules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the third part, which gives measures for transplantation
in Alsace-Lorraine. The German authorities applied in
these annexed departments characteristic methods for the transport
of populations. It so happens that, as the witness from Luxembourg
was heard sooner than I had anticipated, the Tribunal is already
informed of the aspect which these measures of transplantation
assumed in the annexed territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation which I am about to describe with respect to
Alsace and Lorraine is, indeed, analogous to the situation which
existed with regard to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The principal
purpose of the application of such methods by the Germans
was to enable them to colonize by bringing German subjects into
the country, who then seized the lands and property of the inhabitants
who had been expelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second advantage was the elimination of groups considered
especially difficult to assimilate. I should like to quote in this
connection—this will be Document Number RF-749—what Gauleiter
Wagner stated in a speech given at Saverne, according to the
<span class='it'>Dernières Nouvelles de Strasbourg</span>, of 15 December 1941.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today we must make up our mind. In the moment of our
nation’s supreme struggle—a struggle in which you, too, must
participate—I can only say to anyone who says ‘I am a
Frenchman!’ ‘Get the hell out of here! In Germany there is
room only for Germans.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From the beginning the Germans proceeded, firstly, to the
expulsion of individuals or small groups, especially Jews and
members of the teaching profession. Moreover, as is shown by a
document which I have already cited this morning under Number
RF-701 and which was the first general protest made by the French
Delegation, under date of 3 September 1940, the Germans authorized
the people of Alsace-Lorraine to return to their homes only if they
acknowledged themselves to be of German origin. Now the Tribunal
will understand that these restrictions upon the return of refugees
were in themselves equivalent to expulsion. Mass expulsions began
in September 1940. I now submit in this connection Document
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>
Number RF-750; it is again a note from the French Armistice
Delegation taken from the files of the High Court of Justice. I shall
now read this document, Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Since then it has been brought to the knowledge of the
French Government that the German authorities are proceeding
to mass expulsions of families in the three eastern
departments. Every day French citizens, forced to abandon
all their belongings on the spot, are driven into the unoccupied
part of France in groups of 800 to 1,000 persons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was only the 19th of September. On the 3rd of November the
Germans undertook the systematic expulsion of the populations of
the Moselle region. This operation was accomplished with extreme
perfidy. The Germans, as a matter of fact, gave the Lorrainers of
certain localities the choice of either going to eastern Germany or
going to France. They gave them only a few hours to make up their
minds. Moreover, they sought to promote the belief that such a
choice was imposed upon the Lorrainers as a result of an agreement
reached with the French authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the physical point of view, the transport of these people
was effected under very difficult conditions. The Lorrainers were
allowed to take away only a very small part of their personal
belongings and a sum of 2,000 francs, plus 1,000 francs for the
children. On 18 November, four trains filled with Lorrainers who
had been torn away from their homes were headed for Lyons. The
arrival in unoccupied France of these people who had been so
sorely tried was for them, nevertheless, an opportunity for nobly
manifesting their patriotic sentiments. With regard to the facts
which I have presented I place before the Tribunal Document
Number RF-751, which is a note of protest on the part of the French
Delegation signed by General Doyen, dated 18 November 1940.
I shall read excerpts of this Document Number RF-751, beginning
with Paragraph 3 of Page 1:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“France is faced with an act of force which is in formal contradiction
to the armistice convention as well as the assurance,
recently given, of a desire for collaboration between the two
countries. On the contrary, in Article 16, which the German
commission had frequently invoked with specific regard to
the departments of the East, the armistice convention stipulates
the reinstallation of refugees in the regions in which
they were domiciled. The creation of new refugees constitutes,
therefore, a violation of the armistice convention. France is
faced with an unjust act affecting peaceful populations against
whom the Reich has nothing to reproach and who, settled for
centuries on these territories, have made of them a particularly
prosperous region.
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk448'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The unexpected decision of the German authorities is likewise
an inhuman act. In the very middle of winter, without
warning, families have to leave their homes, taking with
them only a strict minimum of personal property and a sum
of money absolutely insufficient to enable them to live even
for a few weeks. Thousands of Frenchmen were thus suddenly
hurled into misery without their country—already too heavily
tried and surprised by the suddenness and amplitude of the
measures adopted without its knowledge—being in a position
to assure them, from one day to the next, a normal livelihood.
This exodus and the conditions under which it is taking place
cause most painful and sorrowful impressions throughout the
French nation. The French people are particularly disturbed
by the explanations given to the Lorrainers, according to
which the French Government was reputed to be the source
of their misfortune.</p>
<hr class='tbk449'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is that impression, in fact, which the poster in certain
villages, where the population had to choose between leaving
for eastern Germany or for Unoccupied France, was intended
to convey.</p>
<hr class='tbk450'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The poster is appended hereto, but we are not in possession
of the text of this poster. That also encouraged the belief
that these populations had themselves requested permission
to leave following the appeals broadcast by the Bordeaux
radio. Even if we admit that such appeals had been made by
radio, it should be noted that the Bordeaux radio station is
under German control. The good faith of the Lorrainers has
been deceived as was shown by their reaction on arrival in
the free zone.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of these protests, the expulsions continued. They reached
a total of about 70,000 people, augmented by the deportation of
Alsatians and Lorrainers to Eastern Germany and to Poland. These
deportations were meant to create terror, and they particularly
affected the families of men who had rightfully decided to refuse
the German demand for forced labor and military service. (I am at
present regarding the whole question of a French protest dated
3 September 1942; it is Document Number RF-752).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since I do not wish to read to the Tribunal texts dealing with
an identical subject I submit this document solely to show that this
protest was made, and I believe that I can refrain from reading its
content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall refer, desiring to give only a short citation, to a document
belonging to the American Prosecution. This document bears the
Number R-114. It is a memorandum of the minutes of a meeting
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>
which took place between several officials of the SS concerning
general directions in regard to the treatment of deported Alsatians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be observed that this document has already been submitted
by my American colleagues under Document Number R-114,
Exhibit Number USA-314, the French Number RF-753. I merely
wish to read one paragraph of that document, which may be interpreted
as a supplement to this problem of deportation. I must say
that these sentences have not been formally read in Court. The
passage that I cite is on Page 2 of the document. At the end of that
there is a paragraph which begins with the letter “d”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For further resettlement are destined:</p>
<hr class='tbk451'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Members of the patois group. The Gauleiter would like to
keep only those persons in the patois area who by their
customs, language, and general attitude testify their adherence
to Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk452'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Regarding the cases mentioned under a-d, it is to be noted
that the racial problem is to be given foremost consideration,
that is, in a way by which racially valuable persons shall be
resettled in Germany proper, and the racially inferior in
France.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I should like to read to the Tribunal a few sentences
from a newspaper article, which appeared in <span class='it'>Dernières Nouvelles
de Strasbourg</span>, August 31, 1942—we are here dealing with a citation
and not a document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 28th of August the families designated hereafter, of
the Arrondissements of Mulhouse and Guebwiller, were
deported to the Reich in order that they might recover a
trustworthy German outlook in National Socialist surroundings.
In several cases the persons involved did not conceal
their hostility in that they stirred up sentiments of opposition,
spoke French in public in a provocative manner, did not obey
the ordinances concerning the education of youth, or in other
ways showed a lack of loyalty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I would now like to indicate to the Tribunal that deportation
or transportation entailed also the spoliation of property. This is
not merely a fact; for the Germans it is a law. Indeed, there is an
ordinance of 28 January 1943, which appeared in the <span class='it'>Official
Bulletin</span> for 1943, Page 40, bearing the title, “Ordinance Concerning
the Safeguarding of Property in Lorraine as a Result of Transplantation
Measures.” I have placed this ordinance before you as
Document Number RF-754. I would like to read Article One and
the first paragraph of Article Two. I believe that the title itself is
a sufficient indication of the contents:
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Article One. The safeguarding of property of people transplanted
from Lorraine to the Greater German Reich or to
territory placed under the sovereign power of Germany has
been entrusted to the transfer services for Lorraine under the
Chief of the Administration.</p>
<hr class='tbk453'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Article Two. These services are authorized to put in effective
safekeeping the property of the Lothringians who have been
transplanted in order that such property may be administered,
and—insofar as orders may have been given for this—exploited.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This ordinance, therefore, still manifests some scruples of form.
The intention is to “safeguard,” but we now know what the word
“safeguard” means in Nazi terminology. We have already seen
what safeguarding meant in the case of works of art and Jewish
property. Even here, we have been specifically warned that the
term “safeguard” carries with it the right of disposal or exploitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other texts are even more specific or clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is Document Number RF-755. This is the ordinance of
6 November 1940 pertaining to the declaration of property in Lorraine
belonging to the enemies of the people and of the Reich. And
on the same subject I shall also submit to you Document Number
RF-756, which is the regulation of 13 July 1940 applying to property
in Alsace belonging to the enemies of the people and of the Reich.
These two texts, one of which applies to Alsace and the other to
Lorraine, permit the seizure and confiscation of properties designated
as “enemy property.” Now, to realize the extent of the
property covered by this term, I will read Document 756:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Any objects and rights of any nature whatsoever, without
regard to conditions of title, which are utilized for, or intended
for use in, activities hostile to the people of Germany or the
Reich will be considered as property belonging to the people
and to the Reich.</p>
<hr class='tbk454'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Such stipulation shall apply to the entire patrimony:</p>
<hr class='tbk455'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(a) of all political parties, as well as of secondary or complementary
organizations depending thereon;</p>
<hr class='tbk456'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(b) of lodges and similar associations;</p>
<hr class='tbk457'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(c) of Jews;</p>
<hr class='tbk458'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(d) of Frenchmen who have acquired property in Alsace
since 11 November 1918;</p>
<hr class='tbk459'/>
<p class='noindent'>“(e) The Chief of the Administration Department and the
Police will decide what patrimony in addition to the property
mentioned above is likewise to be considered as property
belonging to the enemies of the people and of the Reich. He
will likewise decide on doubtful cases.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We see, therefore, that in spite of the title, we are not dealing
here with the measures of sequestration of enemy property taken
in all countries within the scope of the laws of war. First of all,
these are measures of definite confiscation; and in addition, they
are applied to the property of numerous individuals who are in no
wise subjects of enemy countries. We also see at this point the
absolutely arbitrary power placed in the hands of the administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These texts are accompanied by many regulations; although the
spoliations are particularly important in Alsace and in Lorraine,
I shall not speak of them here in more detail, as the Prosecution
has already dealt with the subject. I shall merely limit myself to
the mentioning of two institutions special to Alsace and to Lorraine,
that is, agricultural colonization, and industrial colonization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, agricultural colonization is not a term that has
been invented by the Prosecution; it is an expression which the
Germans used. I submit in this connection, Document Number
RF-757, which is the ordinance of 7 December 1940, “Pertaining to
the New Regime of Settlement or Colonization in Lorraine.” I shall
read the beginning of this Document Number RF-757:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Real estate which has been vacated in Lorraine as a result
of deportations will serve principally for the reconstitution of
a German peasant class and for the requirements of internal
colonization. In this connection and specifically in order to
set us the required programs, I order, by virtue of the powers
which have been conferred upon me by the Führer, the
following:</p>
<hr class='tbk460'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Article One. Real estate property of individuals deported
from Lorraine shall be seized and confiscated for the benefit
of the Chief of the Civil Administration.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I will not cite the second paragraph of Article One, but I will cite
Article Two:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Agricultural properties or forest properties which are seized
in consequence of the ordinance concerning enemy property
of the people and the Reich in Lorraine are confiscated.
Insofar as they are needed, they are included in the methodical
organization of the region.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Article Three:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In addition to the cases provided for in Articles One and
Two and according to the needs, other real estate property
may be included in the programs for methodical reorganization
if appropriate compensation is provided for.</p>
<hr class='tbk461'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of the Civilian Administration and the services
designated by him will decide upon the amount and nature
of the compensation. Any recourse to the law on the part of
the person involved is forbidden.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span></p>
<p class='noindent'>Thus the Tribunal can see in a striking manner the processes and
the methods pursued by the German authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first ordinance, cited earlier, spoke only of safeguarding the
property of people who had been deported or displaced. A second
ordinance now speaks of confiscations. It still refers only to the
notion of enemies of the people and of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third ordinance is more complete, since it comprises confiscation
prescriptions which are quite formal in their character, and
which are no longer qualified as “safeguarding” property which has
become vacant as the result of deportations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This agricultural colonization of which I have spoken assumed
a special importance in Lorraine. On the other hand, it is in Alsace
that we find the greatest number of measures involving a veritable
industrial colonization. These measures consisted in stripping the
French industrial enterprises for the benefit of German firms. On
this subject there are protests of the French Delegation to the
Armistice Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit as documents three of these protests, Documents Numbers
RF-758, 759 and 760, which are notes under date of—respectively—27
April 1941, 9 May 1941, and 8 April 1943. I believe that
it is preferable for me not to read these documents to the Tribunal
and that I merely ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of them,
as proof of the existence of these protests, because I fear that such
a reading would be a mere repetition to the Tribunal, to whom the
matter of economic spoliation has already been explained in sufficient
detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall say, finally, that the Germans carried their audacity to
the point of demanding the seizure in Unoccupied France and the
transportation to Alsace of assets belonging to French companies
which were by this means stripped of their property and actually
“colonized.” I am speaking of assets belonging to companies in the
other zone of France, under the control of the regular shareholders
of such companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it is worth while considering just one example of such
procedure, contained in a very short document, which I submit to
you under Document Number RF-761. This document appears in the
Archives of the French Agencies of the Armistice Commission, to
which it had been sent by the director of the company mentioned
in the document. It is a paper which is partly written in German
and partly translated into French—in the same document—and it is
signed by the German Commissioner for a French enterprise called
the Société Alsacienne et Lorraine d’Electricité. In Alsace this
enterprise had been placed illegally under the administration of this
commissioner, and the commissioner—as the document will show—had
come to Paris to seize the remainder of the company’s assets.
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
He drafted this document, which he signed and which he also made
the president of the French company sign. This document is of
interest as revealing the insolence of German procedure and also
the Germans’ odd conception of law. I quote now:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today the undersigned has instructed me that in future I am
strictly forbidden to take legal action with regard to the
property of the former Société Alsacienne et Lorraine
d’Electricité. If I should transgress this order in any way,
I know that I shall be punished.</p>
<hr class='tbk462'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Paris, 10 March 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk463'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Signed: Kucka.</p>
<hr class='tbk464'/>
<p class='noindent'>“F. B. Kommissar.</p>
<hr class='tbk465'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Signed: Garnier.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now this German economic colonization in the areas annexed
was to serve as an experiment for the application of similar methods
on a broader scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There will be submitted to the Tribunal, in this connection, a
document concerning a colonization attempt in the French Department
Ardennes. On this procedure of annexation by the Germans
of Alsace and of Lorraine, many other items could be cited; and I
could submit many more documents—even if I were to deal only
with the circumstances and the documents which are useful from
the point of view of our own Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to limit myself in order to save the time of the Tribunal
and to comply with the necessities of this Trial where so many
items have to be discussed. Therefore I have limited myself to the
submission of documents or to examples which are particularly
characteristic. I believe that this documentation will enable the
Tribunal to appraise the criminality of the German undertakings
which I have brought to its attention—criminality which is particularly
characteristic of military conscription, which is a criminal
offence since it entails deaths. At the same time I believe the Tribunal
can evaluate the grave sufferings that were imposed for five
years on the populace of these French provinces, already so sorely
tried, in the course of history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have submitted a few details which may have seemed ridiculous
or facetious; but I did so because I thought it desirable that one
should visualize the oppression exercised by the German Administration
in all circumstances of life—even in private life—that
general oppression characterized by the attempt to destroy and
annihilate, and extended in a most complete manner over the
departments and regions which were annexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that the Tribunal will possibly prefer me to leave until
tomorrow my comments with respect to the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg.
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like, moreover, to have the Tribunal’s assent concerning
a question of testimony. I should like to put a witness on the stand,
but it is only a little while ago that I gave the Tribunal a letter
concerning this request. May I ask to be excused for not having
done so earlier because there has been some uncertainty on
this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal finds it convenient, I should like to have this
witness here at tomorrow, Saturday morning’s session. I state that
this witness would be Mr. Koos Vorrink, who is of Dutch nationality.
I also wish to say, for the benefit of Defense, that the question I
would like to submit to the witness will deal with certain items
concerning Germanization in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to call him tomorrow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: If that is convenient to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly, call him tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: If it please the Tribunal, his testimony could be
taken after the recess tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. GUSTAV STEINBAUER (Counsel for Defendant Seyss-Inquart):
Mr. President, I do not wish to prolong the proceedings;
but I believe it will be in the interest of justice if I ask that the
Dutch witness be heard, not tomorrow but Monday, on the assumption
that Seyss-Inquart who is now ill may be expected back on
that date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Faure, would it be equally convenient to
you to call him on Monday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, I do not desire to vex the Defense;
but the witness might like to leave Nuremberg fairly promptly.
Perhaps I might suggest that he be heard tomorrow and that after
he has been heard, if Counsel for Defendant Seyss-Inquart expresses
his desire to cross-examine him, the witness could remain until
Monday’s session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, on the other hand, after having heard the questions involved,
the Counsel considers that there is no need for any cross-examination,
then Seyss-Inquart’s absence would not matter. But I will
naturally accept the decision of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That seems a very reasonable suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: I am agreeable to the suggestion of the
French Prosecutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 2 February 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>FORTY-NINTH DAY</span><br/> Saturday, 2 February 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
the Defendants Kaltenbrunner, Seyss-Inquart, and Streicher will be
absent from this morning’s session due to illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Gentlemen, I shall ask the Tribunal to be kind
enough now to take the file which is entitled “Luxembourg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal has already been informed of the essential elements
of the situation concerning Luxembourg by the testimony of President
Reuter, who was heard during yesterday’s session. I shall,
therefore, be able to shorten my explanations about this file; but it
is nevertheless indispensable that I submit some documents to the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The annexation of Luxembourg has quite a special character, in
that it carried with it the total abolition of the sovereignty of this
occupied country. It therefore concerns a case which corresponds
to the hypothesis which we call “<span class='it'>debellatio</span>” in classic law, that is
to say, the cessation of hostilities by the disappearance of the body
of public law of one of the belligerents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This total annexation of Luxembourg completes the proof that
there was criminal premeditation on the part of the Reich against
this State to which it was bound by diplomatic treaties, notably the
Treaty of London of 11 May 1867, and the Treaty of Arbitration and
Conciliation of 2 September 1929. And the Tribunal knows by the
testimony of Mr. Reuter that these pledges were confirmed, first by
a spontaneous diplomatic step taken on 26 August 1939 by M. Von
Radowitz, the Minister Plenipotentiary for Germany, and afterwards
by a re-assuring declaration a few days before the invasion, in circumstances
which have already been explained to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the fact that Luxembourg—unlike Alsace and Lorraine,
which were French departments—I say, in view of the fact
that Luxembourg was a state, the Germans, in order to carry out
this <span class='it'>de facto</span> annexation, had to issue special regulations concerning
the suppression of public institutions; and this they did. Two
ordinances of 23 August and 22 October 1940 announced, on the one
hand, the ban on Luxembourg’s political parties; and, on the other,
the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and the State Council.
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>
These two decrees are submitted as Documents RF-801 and RF-802.
I request the Tribunal only to take judicial notice of these documents
which are public texts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, from 26 August 1940 on, a German decree had
abolished the constitutional executive formula, according to which
justice is rendered in the name of the sovereign. A formula, according
to which justice is rendered in the name of the people, was
substituted at that time for this executive formula. On 15 October
1941, the formula was again modified in a more obvious way and
became “In the name of the German people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now follow in my supplementary explanation the order of
ideas which I adopted for Alsace and Lorraine; and naturally I shall
dwell only on those circumstances peculiar to Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in the case of Alsace and Lorraine, the Germans attempted
to extirpate the national sentiment of Luxembourg and to render
impossible all manifestations of the traditional culture of this
country. Thus, the ordinances of 28 August 1940 and 23 October
1940 banned all associations of a cultural or educational nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in Alsace and Lorraine, the Germans imposed Germanization
of family and Christian names. This was the object of a decree of
31 January 1941, Document Number RF-803. I point out, in passing,
that the wearing of a beret was also forbidden in Luxembourg, by
a decree of 14 February 1941. At the same time they did away with
national institutions, the Germans set up, according to their custom,
their own administration and appointed a Gauleiter in the person
of Gustav Simon, the former Gauleiter of Koblenz-Trier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the administrative point of view, the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg was administered as a Bezirk (district) of the Chief of
the Civilian Administrative Service but by the German administrative
services. As far as the Party was concerned—the National
Socialist Party—it was officially joined to the Reich, as a dependency
of the Mosel Gau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not dwell on the introduction of German civilian and
penal legislation, which was introduced in the same way as in Alsace
and Lorraine. Sufficient proof of this must be considered to have
been given by the submission of the official report of the government
of the Grand Duchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards nationality and conscription, we also notice a parallelism
between the provisions which concern Luxembourg and those
which concern other annexed countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 August 1942, two ordinances were promulgated. It must
be pointed out that these two ordinances, the one concerning
nationality and the other military service, bear the same date. The
ordinance concerning military service is submitted as Document
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>
Number RF-804 and the one concerning nationality is submitted as
Document Number RF-805. The legislation concerning nationality
includes, moreover, a provision which is peculiar to Luxembourg,
although it is in conformity with the general spirit of German
legislation concerning nationality in annexed countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans had created in Luxembourg various organizations
of the Nazi type, of which the main one was the Volksdeutsche Bewegung
(German nationalist movement); and here is the special
circumstance which I wish to point out. The ordinance of 30 August
1942 concerning nationality grants German nationality to persons
who gave their adherence to this association, the Volksdeutsche
Bewegung. But this nationality could be revoked. This is shown in
the last paragraph of title 1 of this ordinance, Document Number
RF-805. In fact, this conferring of nationality in this special case
was valid provisionally for 2 years only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time that the Nazis were establishing conscription,
they made it obligatory for all young Luxembourgers to serve in the
premilitary formations of the Hitler Youth. This is laid down in an
ordinance of 25 August 1942 concerning the Hitler Youth camps,
which is Document Number RF-806.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as in Alsace and Lorraine, compulsory labor was imposed in
Luxembourg, not only for men but also for women and for work
of military concern. These provisions are found chiefly in three
ordinances: the ordinance of 23 May 1941, the ordinance of 10 February
1943, and the ordinance of 12 February 1943. These last two
ordinances are introduced as Documents RF-807 and RF-808.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should now like to cite another circumstance, which is peculiar
to Luxembourg and of which proof is found in the official report of
the Luxembourg Government already submitted to the Tribunal.
According to this report, Page 4, Paragraphs 7 to 8, it is stipulated—the
quotation is very short and I did put the whole of the Luxembourg
report in my document book; I shall cite only one sentence
which bears the reference I have given:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By ordinance, which appeared in the Official Gazette for Luxembourg,
1942, Page 232, part of the Luxembourg population
was forced to join the formations of a corps called Sicherheits-&nbsp;und
Hilfsdienst (Security and Emergency Service), a
premilitary formation which had to do military drills. Part of
it was sent forcibly to Germany to carry out very dangerous
tasks at the time of the air attacks of the Allied forces.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis made a special effort to bring about the nazification of
Luxembourg; and for this country they thought out a special
method, the basic point of which was the language element. They
developed the official thesis that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
belonged to the German language group. By means of propaganda
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>
they spread the idea that the dialect spoken in Luxembourg was a
Franconian dialect of the Moselle and constituted a variant of the
High German. Having developed this theory, they took a census of
the population, as mentioned yesterday by the witness who gave
evidence before the Tribunal. I especially mention that this census
took place on 10 October 1941. I wished to have the witness speak
on this point because no information on the result of the census was
furnished in the government report; and the Tribunal knows now
the reason why the German authorities immediately stopped the
census as soon as they discovered that the number of persons answering
in the way they desired was ridiculously small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this failure the Germans considered that the Luxembourg
dialect was no longer their political friend and in a circular dated
13 January 1942, which I submit as Document Number RF-809, they
forbade the civil servants to use this dialect in conversations with
the public or on the telephone. This was very inconvenient to a
great many people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nazification campaign was carried out also by the creation
of groups with the same end in view. I have already said that the
most important of these groups was the Volksdeutsche Bewegung
and I shall merely supplement this by citing a sentence from the
Luxembourg report, namely:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Membership in the Volksdeutsche Bewegung was the condition
<span class='it'>sine qua non</span> on which civil servants were allowed to
keep their positions, private employees their positions, professional
people—such as lawyers, doctors, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>—to exercise
their profession, industrialists to run their factories, and
everybody to earn his livelihood. Failure to comply meant
dismissal, expulsion from the country, and the deportation of
whole families.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The penalties imposed on the Luxembourgers who refused these
solicitations were accompanied by a formula which shows very well
the Nazi mentality and which I shall read to the Tribunal from the
text of the government report. It is a very short quotation.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Because of their attitude these persons do not offer the
guarantee that they will fulfill, in an exemplary manner at
all times and without any reservation, during and outside
their professional activity, the duties which have their foundation
in the establishment of the civil administration in
Luxembourg and in the pro-German attitude.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis also sought to develop in Luxembourg the SA formation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have we got this report? Has this governmental
report been deposited?
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The report of the Luxembourg Government was
submitted to the Tribunal by my colleague, M. Dubost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: As I am making only very short quotations from it I
did not put it in my document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, M. Faure, it would help me if you would
give me the page of the dossier, when you are citing a document
which is not in the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The Nazis also used all kinds of constraint to obtain
members for their SA formation as well as for the motorized group
of the SA which is known under the initials NSKK.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like now to point out to the Tribunal that a special
effort was directed towards the youth, because the Nazis thought it
would be easier to get young people—and I may say, even children—to
accept their precepts and doctrines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think I may submit to the Tribunal Document Number RF-810,
which is a circular dated 22 May 1941, addressed to the principals
of high schools. This is a very short document and I ask your
permission to read it.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By order of the Gauleiter, all teachers are bound to buy the
book of the Führer, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, before 1 June 1941. By
September 1941 every member of the teaching profession
must make a declaration on his honor that he has read this
work.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Germans thought that the compulsory reading of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>—they
allowed three months to assimilate this important work—might
convince the teachers, who in turn would teach it to their
pupils in the prescribed spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have here another document, Number RF-811, which I should
like to read to the Tribunal, because it is not long and is also very
characteristic. It is an extract from a collection of circulars addressed
to the pupils of the Athenaeum:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Luxembourg, 16 June 1941:</p>
<hr class='tbk466'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. All pupils must stand up when the teacher enters to begin
the lesson and when leaving the classroom at the end of the
lesson.</p>
<hr class='tbk467'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. The German salute will be given in the following manner:
a) Raise the outstretched right arm to shoulder level, b) Shout:
‘Heil Hitler.’</p>
<hr class='tbk468'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. The pupils must return the same salute which the teachers
use at the beginning and end of the lessons.
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk469'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. I also expect all pupils to give the German salute in the
street, especially to those gentlemen known to be enthusiastic
partisans of the German salute.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These German methods reached their culminating point with the
imposition of the oath of allegiance to Hitler, which oath was
imposed upon the gendarmes and the police. I refer here to the
testimony of M. Reuter, who made the terrible statement that those
who refused to do so were deported and afterwards most of them
were shot. I also submit as proof of this the government report
which gives the same information, on Page 12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, as in the other annexed territories, the Luxembourgers
did not yield to these German methods; and there also endeavors
were made to break the resistance by terror. I must mention a
quite special regulation, the ordinance of 2 June 1941. This will be
Document Number RF-812, which has as title “Ordinance on the
Putting into Force in Luxembourg of the Law of 10 February 1936
Concerning the Gestapo.” This title suffices to show the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gestapo established in Luxembourg special tribunals, a
special summary court known as Standgericht, and SS tribunals.
These jurisdictions, if we can use the term jurisdiction, passed many
sentences for political reasons. A detailed list of these convictions
is appended to the government report. One tribunal, the Standgericht
of which I spoke just now, passed 16 death sentences and
sentenced 384 people to penalties involving loss of their liberty. But
this tribunal was not the only one, and the report states—and the
witnesses also confirmed it—that about 500 were condemned to
death in this country, which is a considerable number, because the
population is not very large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think I should likewise mention, in connection with the Germanization,
the measures concerning deportation already known to
the Tribunal through the testimony of M. Reuter. These measures
concerning deportation were applied systematically to the intellectual
elite of the country, to the clergy, and to persons who had
served in the army. This proves that it was deliberately intended
to do away with the social, intellectual, and moral structure of this
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the Luxembourg report is appended a list of names of deportees,
including officers, magistrates, men who took part in
politics in the Grand Duchy, writers, economic leaders, and in
particular—I shall give only one figure which is striking—the Germans
expelled or deported 75 clergymen, which, with regard to a
population as small as that of Luxembourg, shows clearly the will
to abolish completely the right to worship. The official report also
states that the property of religious orders was confiscated, and most
of the places of worship were either destroyed or desecrated.
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Just a word about agricultural colonization: An organization
called “Für Deutsches Volkstum und Siedelung” (For the Settlement
of Racial Germans) was entrusted with the liquidation of the property
of Luxembourg deportees for the benefit of southern Tyroleans
who were settled in the Grand Duchy. Also, industrial and economic
colonization: Here we find the same methods, the same spoliations,
and therefore I do not want to go over this ground again. The
Tribunal already knows the way in which this was carried out. But
I should like to give one example concerning Luxembourg because
when dealing with points, even general points, I think the best
method is to give a documentary example, and also because,
from this document that I am going to cite, I think it is possible to
draw some important conclusions from the point of view of the
Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document which I am going to cite concerns many cases
where the German authorities compelled private citizens and firms
to transfer their assets and the control of their businesses to Germans.
That was called colonization, and consisted in putting German
nationals into the businesses with large assets and economic functions.
The Reich Minister of Economy himself devised these illicit
methods by which it was intended to plunder private citizens and
to germanize the economy of the country. The document that I am
going to read to the Tribunal bears the Document Number 813.
It is offered as a document by the Luxembourg Government, and
it is an original document with the signature, bearing the heading
“The Reich Minister of Economy,” Berlin, 5 January 1942. This
letter with the heading “The Minister of Reich Economy” is signed
“By order: Dr. Saager.” He is a subordinate who is acting regularly,
administratively, by order of his minister. It is Number RF-813, the
last but one. This letter is marked “Secret.” It concerns the “Accumulateurs
Tudor, S. A., Bruxelles,” and is addressed to the battery
factory in the hands of Mr. Von Holtzendorff of Berlin, Askanischer
Platz 3. The Tribunal will understand that the Minister of Economy
is writing to the German firm which is going to benefit by the
pressure to be exercised on the Luxembourg firm.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Referring to our repeated conversations I confirm that in the
interest of the Reich it would be considered very desirable if
your company would obtain a participation in the stock of the
Tudor Batteries. The interest of the Reich is based in no
small degree on economic requirements of national defense.</p>
<hr class='tbk470'/>
<p class='noindent'>“In order to obtain a majority the stock owned by M. Léon
Laval, formerly in Luxembourg and now in Bad Mergentheim,
would have to be considered first. This concerns not only the
shares which M. Laval possesses personally, but also the 3,000
shares deposited with Sogeco.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>I now come to a very important paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I therefore request that the necessary negotiations be started
immediately. I would point out that, first of all, you will have
to apply to the Gestapo for the authorization of the State
Police to negotiate with M. Laval, and then request them to
give their agreement to the transfer of these shares to your
company in case M. Laval should be willing to cede them.</p>
<hr class='tbk471'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I have already informed the Gestapo of the matter. If the
result of your negotiations should make it necessary I am
prepared to point out once again to the Gestapo how urgent
your mission is.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now I should like to read to the Tribunal the sequel to this,
Document Number RF-814, which shows a further stage of the
maneuver by which the Reich Minister of Economy, in conjunction
with the Gestapo, sought to plunder a private citizen. This is a
letter addressed to a private citizen, who was going to be compelled
to sell his shares, Dr. Engineer Léon Laval, and we are going to
see who writes to him. Here is the text of this letter, which is dated
Luxembourg, 14 January 1942, and which bears the heading of the
Einsatzkommando of the Security Police and the SD in Luxembourg:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 19 January 1942 and the following days you must remain
at your residence to be at the disposal of the representative
of the Accumulatoren-Fabrik, A.G., Berlin, Director Von
Holtzendorff.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will recognize the name of Von Holtzendorff, who
was the recipient of the letter from the Reich Minister of Economy
in the previous document. I continue the quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Mr. Von Holtzendorff, who is in possession of a special authorization
from the Redchssicherheitshauptamt, will discuss business
matters with you. Heil Hitler! Signed, Hartmann.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will understand, I am sure, that if I have read
these two documents, it is not because I think it very important in
the scope of this Trial that the Tudor battery firm was despoiled, an
illicit act which was to their prejudice; but I want especially, and
I think it is very important in the Trial, to emphasize—and I shall
do it each time when the document gives me the opportunity—the
co-ordination which existed between the different German services
of which these defendants here were the leaders. Certain persons
are sometimes inclined to believe that all the German crimes must
be imputed to the Gestapo, and it is true that the Gestapo was a
characteristic criminal organization; but the Gestapo did not function
all by itself. The Gestapo acted on the order of, and in conjunction
with, the civil administrations and with the military
command. We heard yesterday, in connection with the pontificals
of the Bishopric of Strasbourg and also in connection with the
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span>
University of Strasbourg, of the scheme which allowed the civil
minister or his representative to have recourse to the police agents
for the enforcement of orders. We also noted this fact when reading
these documents which dealt with economic matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now conclude the first chapter of my brief. I should like to
mention that the work on the documentation and the preparation of
this chapter was carried out with the aid of my assistant, M. Albert
Lentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like now to hand to the Tribunal the first part of the
second chapter, concerning the seizure of sovereignty. This first part
includes general ideas which I think I should expound to the Tribunal
before supporting them by documents. Consequently, the
Tribunal will have before them a file entitled “Exposé” for which
there is no corresponding document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans occupied the territories of five powers, without
counting Luxembourg which was annexed and of which I spoke just
now. Of these five countries, three kept governmental authority.
These are Denmark, Norway, and France, but even in these three
countries the cases are entirely different. The government of Denmark
was a legitimate government; the government of France was a
<span class='it'>de facto</span> government, which at the beginning exercised real authority
over unoccupied territories; the government of Norway was also a
<span class='it'>de facto</span> government, typical example of a puppet government. The
two other powers, Belgium and Holland, retained no governmental
authority but only administrative authorities, of which the highest
were the general secretariats of the ministerial departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of these situations, the Germans, as I said previously,
varied their methods of domination. On the other hand, they did
not establish a specific form of government corresponding to the
internal organization of each country; therefore looking at it as a
whole, it would seem at first sight to be somewhat complex. The
usurpation of sovereignty by the occupying power assumed three
different forms. We are speaking here of the external procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First form: Direct exercise of power to legislate or issue regulations.
By this we mean the exercise of power above and beyond
the limited power to issue regulations accorded by international
law to occupation armies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second form: The indirect exercise of power to legislate or issue
regulations through local authorities. This was also done in two
ways: 1. By injunction, pure and simple, which is the case when
the local authorities are the administrative authorities. 2. By
pressure, which is the case when the local authorities are authorities
of a governmental character, either <span class='it'>de facto</span> or <span class='it'>de jure</span>. It should
be noted, moreover, that the pressure is sometimes such that it bears
a complete resemblance to an injunction, pure and simple. We also
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>
understand such pressure to include recourse to the complicity of
traitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Third form: The third form is purely and simply that of assault
and battery. We do not mean physical force used in individual
cases, for this does not concern us here: but physical force used as
a result of the order of a competent occupation authority, which
consequently entails the responsibility of a superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we now consider the question of determining who or what the
instruments of usurpation were, we observe that these instruments
fall into five categories:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, we have the Reich Commissioner, who was
appointed in Norway and Holland only, that is to say, in the one
case in a country which retained governmental authority at least in
appearance and for a certain length of time, and in the other, in a
country which retained administrative authority only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second place, we have the military administration. In all
countries the military authorities exercised powers absolutely disproportionate
to those which belonged to them lawfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must note here that only these two instruments, the Reich Commissioner
and the military authority, were able to carry out usurpation
by issuing direct legislative or regulatory decrees. In each of
the two powers where there was a Reich Commissioner, the powers
conferred were naturally shared by the Reich Commissioner and the
military authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A third instrument of usurpation took the form of diplomatic
administration responsible to the Foreign Office. Diplomatic representations
existed only in countries which had governmental
authorities and where there was no Reich Commissioner. We refer
to Denmark and France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These diplomatic representatives of the Reich, unlike the Reich
Commissioner and the military occupation authority, did not have
power—illicit but formal power—to legislate or issue regulations.
However, this does not mean that their role in the usurpation of
sovereignty is a secondary one. On the contrary, it is an important
one. Their principal activity consisted, naturally, in bringing pressure
to bear on local authorities to whom they were accredited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to bring out two points here. It might be thought
from a logical point of view, that in an occupied country such as
France, the intervention by the occupying power in the administration
of the local authorities would be the exclusive competence
of the diplomatic representatives. That is not the case. The military
authority also intervened on frequent occasions through direct
contact with the French authorities. In their turn, the diplomatic
representatives did not limit themselves to the powers conferred
<span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span>
by their functions. One of the characteristics of the Nazi method is
this exceeding of powers conferred. It is, moreover, when one thinks
of it, a necessary result of the Nazi enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the fact that the usurpation of sovereignty in a
country which is militarily occupied is an illegal and abnormal
thing, it does not come within the normal competency of the categories
of public functions as understood by civilized nations. Thus
the diplomats, as well as the military authorities, exceeded their
powers; and there was also an overlapping of functions. The
diplomats and the military authorities dealt with the same things.
We see this in regard to propaganda, for instance; and in regard to
the persecution of the Jews. Generally speaking, the military authority
acted in a more obvious way; the diplomatic administration
preferred to act in domains where publicity could be evaded. There
was a constant liaison between them on all questions concerning the
occupied country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth instrument of usurpation was the police administration.
The German police was installed in all occupied countries, often
under several distinct administrations, according to the principles
which were presented to the Tribunal when the American Prosecution
revealed the inner workings of the immense, complex, and
terrible police organism of the Nazis. Neither did the police have
limited or exclusive functions. They acted in close and constant
liaison with the other instruments we have defined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth instrument which we must mention consisted of the
local branches of the National Socialist Party and the similarly
inspired organizations which sought to organize nationals in the
occupied country. These organizations served as auxiliaries to the
German authorities; and in a specific case, that of Norway, they
provided the foundation of a so-called government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have thought fit to outline this picture, as it seems to me that
the Prosecution may draw from it an interesting conclusion in
regard to the points I have already touched on in my statement on
Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have seen, in effect, that the German line of policy for the
usurping of sovereignty was carried out by means of various organs
which were associated with this action. In the occupied countries—and
we must not forget that this usurpation provided the method
for the commission of crimes—this usurpation was not the exclusive
work of an official, or of an ambassador, or of a military commander.
In countries which had a Reich Commissioner there also existed a
military administration. A country placed under the sole regulating
authority of the Army also had diplomatic agents. In all countries
there were police authorities.
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In all these occupied countries, as a result of the occupation and
the usurpation of sovereignty, there were systematic abuses and
crimes. Many of them are already known to the Tribunal. Others
have still to be mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From what I have just said, we see that the responsibility for
these abuses does not exist only with one or the other of these
administrations which we have mentioned, it exists with all of them.
It may be true that in Belgium, for instance, there was no diplomatic
representation; but there was such representation in France and in
Denmark. It therefore follows that the Department of Foreign
Affairs and its head could not help being aware of the conditions
under the occupation which, as far as the principal features are
concerned, were similar in the different countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, as I have just said, these coexisting administrations
had no fixed division of functions. Even if this division of functions
had existed, it must be pointed out that the responsibility and the
complicity of each in the action of the others would have been
sufficiently proved by their knowledge and their approval—which
was at least implicit with regard to this action. But even this
division did not exist, and we shall show that all were associated
and accomplices in a common action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, this very fact involves a more far reaching consequence.
The association and complicity of these various departments involves
all the leaders and all the organizations here accused in a general
responsibility. I shall explain this point by giving an example. If,
for instance, all the abuses and all the crimes had been committed
only by the Army without a single interference, perhaps it would
be possible for one important person, or organization, having no
military functions, to claim that it had no knowledge of these abuses
and of these crimes. Even in this case I think this claim would be
difficult to uphold, because the vast scope of the enterprises which
we denounce made it impossible for anyone who exercised a higher
authority not to know of these things. However, since several
administrations are jointly responsible, it necessarily follows that
the other authorities are also responsible, because the question at
this point is no longer the question whether one administration is
involved, or even three, but all the administrations; it involves the
consubstantial element of all the authorities of the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall speak later of the order concerning the deportation of the
Jews; and I shall show that this order was the result of a common
action of the military administration, the diplomatic administration,
and the Security Police, in the case of France. It follows that in the
first place the Chief of the High Command, in the second place, the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in the third place, the Chief of the
Security Police and Reich Security Service—these three persons—were
<span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span>
all necessarily informed and necessarily approved this action,
for it is clear that their offices did not keep them in ignorance of
such plans concerning important affairs and that, moreover, decisions
were agreed upon on the same level in the three different administrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore these three persons are responsible and guilty. But is
it possible that, by an extraordinary chance, among the persons who
directed the affairs of the Reich, as ministers or as persons holding
equivalent offices, these three persons turned out to be criminals
and the only ones to be criminals and that they had conspired
among themselves to hide from the others their criminal actions?
This idea is manifestly absurd. In view of the interpenetration of
all the executive departments in a modern state, all the leaders of
the Reich were necessarily aware of and agreed with the usurpation
of sovereignty in the occupied countries, as well as the criminal
abuses resulting therefrom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this chapter I shall go on to speak first of Denmark, which is
a special case. Then I shall speak of the civil administration which
existed in Norway and in Holland, and finally I shall speak of the
military administration which was the regime in Belgium and in
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it would be a suitable time now for the Tribunal to have
a recess; or if the Tribunal prefers, I can continue my brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: After the recess I should like to call the witness of
whom I spoke to the Tribunal yesterday. I should like to mention
one fact, however. Yesterday the lawyer for Seyss-Inquart requested
that he be allowed to cross-examine this witness on Monday. Senator
Vorrink, who is my witness, is absolutely obliged to leave
Nuremberg this evening. I think, therefore, that the lawyer for
Seyss-Inquart might cross-examine him today. In any case I should
like to notify him of the modification of the request which I made
yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wouldn’t it be possible, if the counsel for
Seyss-Inquart wants to cross-examine the witness, for the witness
to be brought back at some other date?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: My witness can of course be brought back at another
date, if it should be necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is what I meant. Let him go this
evening in accordance with arrangements that he has made, and
then at some date convenient to him he could be brought back if the
defendant’s counsel wants to cross-examine him.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, may I ask the permission of the
Tribunal to call the witness, Jacobus Vorrink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, have him called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: This witness speaks Dutch as his native tongue.
Since the interpreting system does not include this language, I
propose that he speak in the German language, which he knows well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness, Jacobus Vorrink, took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is your name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>JACOBUS VORRINK (Witness): Vorrink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Your Christian name, your first name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Jacobus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you swear to speak without hate or fear,
to say the truth, all the truth, and only the truth? Will you raise
your right hand and say, “I swear”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Sit down, Mr. Vorrink. You are a Dutch Senator?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: You are President of the Socialist Party of the Netherlands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: You exercised these functions in 1940 at the time of
the invasion of the Netherlands, by the Germans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I should like to ask you to give a few explanations
on the following situation: There existed in the Netherlands, before
the invasion, a National Socialist Party. I should like you to state
what the situation was, after the invasion by the Germans and
during the occupation, with regard to the various political parties
in the Netherlands, and more particularly the National Socialist
Party, and what were the activities of this Party in liaison with the
German occupation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I should prefer to speak in the Dutch language. I am
sorry I do not know French and English well enough to use these
languages—but in order not to delay the proceedings, I shall make
my declarations in German. This is the only reason why I am using
the German language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political situation in Holland after the invasion by the Germans
was that first and foremost the German Army wanted to
maintain public order in Holland. But the real Nazis immediately
came with the Wehrmacht and tried to direct and organize public
life in Holland according to their concepts. There were among the
Germans three main categories. In the first place, there were those
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span>
who believed in the “blood and soil” (Blut und Boden) theory. They
wanted to win over the whole of the Dutch people to their National
Socialist concepts. I must say that, in certain respects, this was our
misfortune because these people, on the basis of their “blood and
soil” theory, loved us too much and when that love was not reciprocated
it turned to hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second category consisted of the politically informed; and
these people knew perfectly well that the Dutch National Socialists
in Holland were only a very small and much hated group. At the
elections of 1935 they received only 8 percent of the votes, and
2 years later this percentage had been reduced by one-half. These
people were tactlessness itself. For instance, when the ruins of
Rotterdam were still smoking, they saw fit to make a demonstration
at which the leader of the Dutch National Socialists, Mussert,
dedicated to Göring a new bell as a thank offering for what he had
done for Holland. Fortunately, it did not prevent him from being
defeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the third place there were the so-called intriguers, those who
wanted to destroy the national unity of Holland and who, first of
all, tried through Seyss-Inquart to gain the favor of the Dutch
people by flattery. In the same way as Seyss-Inquart, they always
stressed that the two peoples were kindred races and should therefore
work together, while behind the scenes they played off one
Nazi group against the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland at that time there existed the Dutch National
Socialist Workers’ Party, the Dutch National Socialist Front,
and the so-called National Front. All these three movements
had their contacts with certain German organizations. The Germans
first tried to find out whether it was possible to use these groups for
their purposes. Slowly, however, they recognized that it was not
possible to work with these groups; and so they decided to adopt
the National Socialist movement only. These National Socialists
gradually occupied the key positions in the Dutch administration.
They were appointed general secretaries for internal administration,
they became commissioners of the provinces, mayors, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to mention in this connection that at that time
there were not enough people qualified to become mayors, so that
short courses of instruction were arranged which performed the
record feat of turning out Dutch mayors in 3 weeks. You can
imagine what kind of mayors they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, they became administrators in nazified organizations
and commercial undertakings, which gave them certain power in
Holland; and they behaved like cowardly Nazi lackeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rost von Tonningen, for instance, used millions of Dutch
guilders to finance the war against Russia in order to fight against
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>
Bolshevism as he called it. Finally, in December 1942, Seyss-Inquart
declared the Nazi Party to be the representative of the political life
of Holland. If it had not been so tragic, one might have laughed at
it. Mussert was then appointed as the Leader of Holland. I must
add that the Nazi Party had only a shadow existence from the
political point of view, with the single but important exception that
these people had occasionally the opportunity to deal with matters
of personnel. I should also add that sometimes they turned the
heads of young Dutchmen and persuaded several thousands of them
to enter the SS formations; and during the last years it became
even worse. Then they even went so far as to put young boys into
the SS without their parents’ consent. They even forced minors
from correctional institutions into the SS. Sometimes—I know of
cases myself—young boys who for certain reasons were at loggerheads
with their parents, were taken into the SS. To realize the
harm done you must, as I have sometimes done, go and speak to
these children who are now in camps in Holland. You will then
see what a monstrous crime has been committed against these young
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Am I to understand that all these methods employed
by the Germans were intended to achieve the nazification of Holland
and that if there were, as you have indicated, several varying tendencies
among the Germans, these tendencies differed only as to
the means to be employed and not in regard to the purpose of
Germanization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: The actual nazification of Holland extended to practically
all spheres of our national life. They tried in every domain
to introduce the Leadership Principle. I would like to point out,
for instance, that contrary to our expectations, they did not ban the
Socialist Trade Unions but just tried to employ them. They merely
sent a Nazi commissioner who told the people, “The era of democracy
is past, just go on working under the leadership of the commissioner
and you can still help the workers. It is not necessary to
change anything.” They even tried that with the Dutch political
parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As President of the Socialist Democratic Workers’ Party of
Holland, I had a long conversation with Rost von Tonningen, who
personally told me that it was a pity that the good cultural work
done to educate the workers should cease. We both wanted socialism
and all we had to do was to work together calmly. I denied that
at the time of that conversation. I told him that for us democracy
was not a question of opportunism but a part of our ideology and
that we were not prepared to betray our convictions and our
principles.
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>They tried to keep the workers in their organizations; but slowly
the workers, thousands and tens of thousands of them, left their
organizations. When finally the National Labor Front was created,
with the Catholic and Christian Trade Unions, there certainly was
an organization but no longer any members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you state with accuracy whether in your country
persecutions against the Jews were started?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: One of the worst chapters of our sufferings in Holland
was the persecution of the Jews. You may know that we in
Holland, and especially in Amsterdam, had a strong Jewish minority.
These Jews took a very active part in the public and cultural life
of Holland, and one can say there was no anti-Semitism in Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Germans first came to Holland, they promised us that
they would not harm the Jews at all. Nevertheless, even in the
first weeks there was a wave of suicides. In the following months
the measures against the Jews started. The professors in the universities
were forced to resign. The president of the highest court
in Holland was dismissed. Then the Jews had to present themselves
for registration, and then came the time when the Jews were deported
in great numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am proud to say that the Dutch population did not suffer this
without protesting. The Dutch students went on strike when their
Jewish professors were driven out, and the workers of Amsterdam
went on strike for several days when the persecution of the Jews
started. But one has to have seen this with one’s own eyes, as I
have, to know what a barbaric system this National Socialism was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Green Police sealed off whole sections of cities, went into
houses, even went on the roofs, and drove out young and old and
took them off in their trucks. No difference was made between
young and old. We have seen old women of over 70, who were
lying ill at home and had no other desire than to be allowed to die
quietly in their own home, put on stretchers and carried out of their
home, to be sent to Westernborg and from there to Germany, where
they died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself remember very well how a mother, when she was
dragged from her home, gave her baby to a stranger, who was not a
Jewess, and asked her to look after her child. At this moment there
are still hundreds of families in Holland where these small Jewish
children are being looked after and brought up as their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you state whether, apart from these measures
against the Jews, the Germans concerned themselves with other
confessions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: From the beginning the Germans always tried to get
the churches into their power. All the churches, the Catholic as
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>
well as the Protestant, protested whenever the Germans violated
human rights. The churches protested against the arbitrary arrest
of persons, against the mass deportation of our workers, and the
church never failed to testify for the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the church dignitaries, the priests and pastors, had to
suffer for that; and hundreds of our pastors and priests were taken
to concentration camps, and of the 20 parsons and priests whom
I knew in the concentration camp in Sachsenhausen, only one has
returned to Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you state what measures were adopted with
regard, for example, to culture, propaganda, and teaching?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: What incensed us most in Holland was not so much
our military defeat. We were a small people, and I can say that
during those 5 days we fought as well as we could. Perhaps it
would have been possible to maintain a correct attitude with the
occupation forces, if it hadn’t been for the Nazis’ determination to
dominate us, not only in a military sense, but also to break our
spirit and to crush us morally. Therefore, they never lost an opportunity
of encroaching on our cultural life in their efforts to nazify us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In regard to the press, for instance, they forced us to publish in
our press editorials which were written by Germans and to print
them on the front page in order to create the impression that the
editor in chief of the paper had written them. One can even say
that these measures were the starting point for the very extensive
underground press in Holland, because we wouldn’t allow the Germans
to lie to us systematically. We had to have a press which told
us the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also in regard to the radio, it was soon forbidden to listen to
foreign stations; and they dealt out exceedingly harsh punishment
to people who defied this ban; and there were a great many people
in Holland who listened to the foreign radio, especially the BBC.
And we in Holland were always glad to hear the British radio which
never hesitated to give the people, <span class='it'>in extenso</span>, all the affecting
speeches of Hitler and Göring, while we were not allowed to listen
to Churchill’s speeches. In those moments we were deeply conscious
of the reasons why we had built up our resistance, and we also
knew why our Allied friends strove with all their might to deliver
the world from the Nazi tyranny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same in the field of the arts. Quite a number of
guilds for painters, musicians, and writers were forced to organize
themselves. An author could not even publish a book without submitting
it to some Nazi illiterate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They also encroached on school life and tried to influence elementary
education; for instance, in the text books for children of 6 to
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>
12 years they ordered that whole sentences should be struck out.
A sentence like the following, “When the Queen visited them the
people cheered.” In the schools and public buildings they organized
real hunts for pictures of our Royal Family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have finished your examination, have you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GENERAL RUDENKO: No questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have the British or American prosecutors
any questions? [<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>] Does any member of the
defendants’ counsel wish now to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Mr. President, in order to avoid the witness
having to make the long trip from Holland a second time, I should
like to cross-examine him today, although my client is absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, when Seyss-Inquart took over the government in Holland
under the decree of 18 May 1940, was the Queen or were
members of the Dutch Government still on Dutch territory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: No, they were no longer on Dutch territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Did the government of Seyss-Inquart, the
Reich Commissioner, leave in office the functionaries of the former
government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know that of the nine General Secretaries
appointed by the former Royal Government and still in office
only one was dismissed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Well, it is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you further know that of the 11 Commissioners
of the Provinces only four were dismissed from the
government for political reasons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I do not know the exact number but that is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know how many mayors were appointed
by the Royal Government and in particular is it correct
that there were more than one-half still in office in 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes, I believe so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: You have not answered fully the question
which was asked you by the prosecutor. He asked you how many
political parties there were in parliament at the time of the invasion.
Which were those parties?
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: The Catholic Party, two Protestant Christian parties,
two liberal parties, the Social Democratic Party, the Communist
Party, and some minor parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: I shall now talk about two subjects mentioned
by you—schools and churches. Is it correct that the Dutch
school system, throughout the Seyss-Inquart regime, was under the
direction of a Dutchman, Van Hann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: It was under a Dutchman during the whole time,
but we do not consider him as a Dutchman. He is today in prison
because he betrayed his country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: But he was not a German?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: He was a Dutch traitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Is it correct that Seyss-Inquart showed great
interest in the Dutch school system?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I cannot remember that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: For instance, Seyss-Inquart added an eighth
class to the elementary school?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: That is not correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: And that in this way adolescents did not
have to enter the labor services until later?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Did he show an interest in a long standing
wish of the Dutch concerning the spelling of the Dutch language
and did he not appoint a special committee to investigate the matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: In this connection he did take some interest in a
thing about which he knew nothing; he got his information from
the wrong people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: But he did make an effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes, but in the wrong direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Is it correct that he endeavored to increase
the number of teachers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: No, certainly not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: That, in particular, he employed junior
teachers and reduced expenses thereby?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: He did that because he wanted to influence the
Dutch youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know, for instance, that as a result
of protests, Seyss-Inquart rescinded measures that had been taken
against the School of Commerce in Rotterdam?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Will you repeat the question? I did not understand
it.
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know that Seyss-Inquart, as a result
of protests, took steps to see that the School of Commerce in Rotterdam
was not interfered with?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: As far as the churches are concerned, apart
from deportation, as you say for political reasons, were the Catholics
and Protestants ever prevented from practicing their religion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: The Germans interfered very much with the right
to worship. They put spies in the churches to listen to the sermons
with the idea of possibly denouncing the pastors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Yes, but that has happened in other countries
too. Please, tell me, could the priest or the parson still continue
to preach according to his conscience?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: No, certainly not according to his conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know that during the whole of the
occupation the prayer for the Queen was allowed in churches of all
denominations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: It was certainly not allowed. Several ministers were
arrested for that very reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know that Seyss-Inquart prevented
27 convents from being confiscated for German refugees? Is it
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I know nothing about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: But perhaps you may know that he prevented
the destruction of the synagogues in Rotterdam and in The
Hague. The police wanted to destroy them, and he prevented them
from doing it. Do you know anything about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I do not know whether he wanted to prevent it;
but in any case, the synagogues were destroyed; and those who
destroyed them went unpunished and later took part in the worst
persecution of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Witness, do you know that out of the Catholic
and Protestant Dutch clergymen deported to Germany, Seyss-Inquart
succeeded in getting two-thirds sent back to their country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Do you know that he prevented the departure
of valuable cultural treasures, especially libraries, which were
already prepared for transportation from Holland to the Reich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I do not know whether he used his personal influence
in that respect; I only know that enormous quantities of our
art treasures and books were taken away by the Germans, and in
any case he was then powerless to prevent it.
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: You said also that the radio was prohibited
because it stimulated the organization of resistance. As a leader,
would you have allowed a radio speaking against you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I would by all means allow the radio. I am of the
opinion that there can be no human dignity if people are not
allowed to form their opinions by hearing reasons for and against.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Was Mussert given the task of forming a
government, or was that not done because Seyss-Inquart objected?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I really do not know what happened behind the
scenes, but perhaps you may be right that Seyss-Inquart was no
friend of Mussert. While in prison I was taken out of my cell one
night and asked to write an article on the National Socialist movement
in Holland, and I was requested to give my own personal
opinion about Mussert. When I answered, ‘Why should I do this?
You know what I think of Mussert and of all the Nazis,’ they said:
‘You cannot make it bad enough.’ I took this to be one of the many
machinations of the Nazi cliques which fought against each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: I thank you. I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Witness, you spoke of Dutch youngsters who had
entered the SS. Could you tell me approximately what the total
number was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I would say a few thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: In your opinion how many of those entered the
ranks voluntarily and how many were forced?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I cannot give you an exact figure; but I am of the
opinion that if minors entered such organizations without the consent
of their parents, they did not do it voluntarily. They could
not judge the consequences of their actions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I did not ask that question. I asked you how
many, in your opinion, joined the SS voluntarily and how many
were forced. Will you answer this question and no other?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I have already said that I cannot give you the exact
number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Well, an approximate figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I should say several hundred were forced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Good, and you gave the total number as several
thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: They were youngsters who for some reason or another
left their homes, and they were taken by the Green Police or the
Security Police and pressed into the SS. I myself have come
across quite a few cases of this in Dutch concentration camps. As
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span>
an old leader in the Youth Movement I was able to speak to these
youngsters and got them to tell me about their life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You say “pressed”? What do you mean by
“pressed”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: That means that they were threatened with imprisonment
if they were not willing to join the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You heard that yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You further said that thousands of workmen left
their organizations. I think you said tens of thousands. Did they
do so voluntarily, or what was the reason for this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: The reasons were that the workmen refused to be
in a nazified trade union and to submit to the Leadership Principle.
They wanted to be in their old trade unions where they could have
a say in the running of their organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The resignations, therefore, were voluntary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: In regard to the Jewish question you said that
at first nothing happened to the Jews, but that nevertheless there
was a wave of suicides. Why? What was the reason for those suicides
when it had been said, “nothing will happen to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: These Jews were the most sensible ones. We in
Holland did not live on an island, and we knew all that had happened
between 1933 and 1940 in Germany. We knew that in Germany
the Jews had been persecuted to death, and I personally still
have in my possession quite a few sworn statements of German
Jews who had emigrated, who kept us hourly informed of how they
had been tortured and martyred by the SS during the period before
the war. That of course was known to the Dutch Jews, and in my
opinion in that respect they were more sensible since they knew
they would suffer the same fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You put it in such a way as to make it sound as
if there were a large number of suicides. Was that so, or were there
a few individual cases?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: This happened to about 30 or 50 people, but in
Holland; where we value life very highly, that is quite a large
number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Now, you used the word “Nazi illiterate.” Quite
apart from, I would say, your not very friendly attitude towards
us Germans, have you any justification for saying this? Have you
met a single German who was illiterate?
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: I am rather surprised at this question. By an “illiterate
Nazi” I meant a man who talks about things about which
he has no knowledge, and the people who judged an author’s work
were people who had been set to read through the book to find out
whether a Jew appeared in it and was presented as a good and
humane character. According to the Nazi concepts, such a book
could not be published. I would add that I have used the word
“Nazi illiterate” from the days when there were found in the
German cities, in the country of Goethe and Schiller, great piles
of burned books, books that we had read and admired in Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I understand you to mean that you can bring no
positive facts which might justify this derogatory word “Nazi illiterate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO PANNENBECKER (Counsel for Defendant Frick):
I have just one question, Witness. You just said that young people
who did not enter the SS were threatened with prison. Do I understand
you to say that they would be given prison sentences for an
offense committed previously or that they would be imprisoned
only because they did not enter the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: They would be given a prison sentence, of course,
because they had been threatened. Whether they would have put
them in prison, I do not know, but it was a threat. It was one of
the usual methods of the Nazis to say “We want you to do this
or that, and if you do not we will put you in prison.” There were
so many instances of this sort that one could have no illusions
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: But it is correct in this case that these
were youngsters who had run away from home because of differences
with their parents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VORRINK: Those are cases which I know of personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other Defense Counsel wish to ask
any questions? [<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>] M. Faure, do you wish to
ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then, the witness can leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I shall ask the Tribunal to be kind enough to take
the brief and the document book, bearing the title “Denmark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal knows that Denmark was invaded on 9 April 1940
in violation, as in other cases, of treaties, and particularly, of a
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>
treaty which was not very old, since it was the Non-Aggression
Treaty which had been concluded on 31 May 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inasmuch as Denmark was not in a position to offer armed
resistance to this invasion, the Germans sought to establish and
maintain the fiction according to which that country was not an
occupied country. Therefore they did not set up a civil administration
with powers to issue regulations as they were to do in the
case of Belgium and Holland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, there was a military command, inasmuch as
troops were garrisoned there. But this military command, contrary
to what happened in the other occupied countries, did not exercise
any official authority by issuing ordinances or general regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of this fiction, the Germans did commit in this country
which they pretended they were not occupying, usurpations of
sovereignty. These usurpations were all the more blatant, inasmuch
as they had no juridical justification whatsoever, even from
the Nazi point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the first period, which extended to the middle of 1943,
German usurpations were discreet and camouflaged. There were
two reasons for this. The first was that one had to take into account
international public opinion, inasmuch as Denmark was not officially
occupied. The second reason was that the Germans had conceived
the plan to germanize the country from within by developing
National Socialist political propaganda there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it should be noted, very briefly, that this Germanization
from within had already begun before the war. It is set forth in
detail and in a most interesting manner in a part of the official
report of the Danish Government, which I place before the Tribunal
as Document Number RF-901.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Document Number RF-901 comprises the whole of the
green dossier which the Tribunal has before it. There are several
sections. The subject of which I am now speaking is to be found
in the first document of this bundle. This first document starts with
the heading “Memorandum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document shows that even before the war the Germans had
organized an information service which was supplemented by a
clever espionage service. In particular they had established a
branch of the National Socialist Party, into which Germans living
in Denmark were recruited. The idea was first of all to form a
party made up of Germans and we shall shortly see how this
National Socialist Party was afterwards called the Danish Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This branch of the German Party was called NSDAP, Ausland-Organisation,
Landeskreis Danemark (Foreign Section, Regional
District Denmark). It acted in co-ordination with other institutions;
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span>
particularly, the Deutsche Akademie, the Danish-German Chamber
of Commerce, and the Nordische Gesellschaft (Nordic Association).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A German organization in Hamburg called the Deutsche Fichtebund,
which was directly under the Reich Ministry of Public
Enlightenment and Propaganda, undertook a systematic propaganda
campaign in order to gain favorable Danish public opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection I should like to quote a passage of the document
which is worthy of note from the point of view of German
premeditation and of the methods employed. This passage is in the
first document which I have just mentioned and which is called
“Memorandum”—on Page 6 of this first document. I shall skip the
first sentence of this paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would point out to the Tribunal, in case it should be more
convenient for them because of the length of the document, that
these quotations are to be found in the exposé:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This information agency, which functioned in Hamburg with
no less than eight different addresses, gave in one of its
publications the following details about itself. It was established
in January 1914 in memory of the German philosopher,
Fichte, and was to be looked upon as a ‘union for world
truth.’ The objects were: (1) The promotion of mutual understanding
by the free publication of information on the new
Germany. (2) The protection of culture and civilization by
the propagation of truth concerning the destructive forces in
the world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip one sentence and continue:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“This German propaganda had for its essential purpose the
creation in Denmark of a nation-wide sentiment favorable
to Germany and hostile to England, but it could also represent
an attempt to prepare the ground for the introduction
into Denmark of a Nazi system of government by collecting
surreptitiously all manifestations of discontent in Denmark
against the democratic regime in order to use such data as
documentary proof in the event of a liberation action in the
future. Thus, in January 1940, the propaganda was no longer
content merely with attacking England and her methods of
conducting the war, or the Jews and their mentality; but it
proceeded to make serious attacks on the mentality of the
government and the Danish Parliament.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in this connection the Danish report mentions a very
revealing incident:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“At the end of February 1940, the Danish police seized from
a German subject, a document entitled, ‘Project for Propaganda
in Denmark.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In saying this, I am summarizing the first paragraph of Page 7
of this report. This document contains a characteristic sentence. It
is the last sentence in that paragraph, in German, and is in quotation
marks with a French translation in parenthesis:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“It should be possible for the Legation and its collaborators
to control the daily press.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Germany did not limit herself to the use of her own subjects
as agents inside the country and for carrying out propaganda, but
the Nazis also inspired the organization of Danish political groups
which were affiliated with the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This campaign first of all found favorable ground in southern
Jutland, where there was a German minority. The Germans thus
were able to promote the organization of a group called Schleswig’sche
Kameradschaft, or SK, which exactly corresponds to the
German SA. The members of this group received military training.
Likewise a group called Deutsche Jugendschaft Nordschleswig had
been organized on the pattern of the Hitler Jugend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to call the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that I am
now summarizing the statements in the Danish report in order to
avoid reading in full. These statements are developed in detail in
the following chapters of the report and what I have just said is
on Page 7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This German infiltration had been completed by social institutions
such as the Wohlfahrtsdienst founded in 1929 at Tinglev,
and the Deutsche Selbsthilfe, founded in 1935, and also by economic
organizations, the model of which was Kreditanstalt Vogelgesang,
which by very clever and secret financing on the part of the Reich,
had succeeded in taking over important agricultural properties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The movement formed in southern Jutland then tried to spread
to the whole of Denmark. Thus, there existed, even before the war,
a National Socialist Party of Denmark, whose leader was Fritz
Clausen. We read in the governmental report, Pages 6 and 7:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“With regard to the relations of the Party with Germany
prior to the occupation it can be said that Fritz Clausen,
himself, as well as the members of the Party, were assiduous
participants at the Party Days held in Nuremberg and at the
Congress of Streicher at Erfurt and that, in any event, Fritz
Clausen personally was in very close relation with the German
Foreign Office.</p>
<hr class='tbk472'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This propagation of Nazism in Denmark, starting in southern
Jutland and spreading to the rest of the country, is illustrated
by the fact that the Nazi newspaper, called <span class='it'>Das Vaterland</span>,
which at first was published in Jutland, was transferred in
<span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span>
October 1939 to Copenhagen, where it was published from
then on as a morning daily.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Such, then, was the situation when the occupation started. As
I have indicated, the Germans did not establish a formal occupation
authority; and it follows that the two principal agents for the usurpation
of sovereignty in Denmark were diplomatic representation,
on the one hand, and the Danish Nazi Party on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Reich Plenipotentiary in Denmark was at first
Von Renthe-Fink, and from October 1942, Dr. Best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cases of diplomatic infringement on Danish sovereignty were
numerous; and the demands, made at first in a discreet manner,
became more and more sweeping. I shall quote, for example, a
document which is contained in the government report. This document
is a memorandum submitted by the Reich Plenipotentiary on
12 April 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I point out to the Tribunal that this text is to be found
in Book Number 3 of the report submitted. This third book is
entitled, “Second Memorandum,” or rather, it is a continuation of
this third book and there is a sheet entitled “Annex One.” I am
now quoting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Reich Plenipotentiary has received instructions
to demand from the Royal Government of Denmark:</p>
<hr class='tbk473'/>
<p class='noindent'>“First: A formal declaration as to whether His Majesty, the
King of Denmark, to whom M. De Kauffmann, Minister of
Denmark now refers, or any other member of the Royal
Danish Government had, prior to its publication, any knowledge
of the treaty concluded between M. De Kauffmann and
the American Government.</p>
<hr class='tbk474'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Second: The immediate putting into effect of the recall of
M. De Kauffmann, Minister of Denmark, by His Majesty, the
King of Denmark.</p>
<hr class='tbk475'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Third: The delivery without delay to the American Chargé
d’Affaires in Copenhagen of a note disavowing M. De Kauffmann,
communicating the fact that he is being recalled, and
stating that the treaty thus concluded is not binding upon
the Danish Government, and formulating the most energetic
protest against the American procedure.</p>
<hr class='tbk476'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Fourth: A communication to be published in the press, according
to which the Danish Royal Government clearly states
that M. De Kauffmann acted against the will of His Majesty,
the King, and of the Danish Royal Government and without
their authorization; that he has been recalled, and that the
Danish Government considers the treaty thus concluded as
<span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span>
not binding upon it and has formulated the most energetic
protests against the American procedure.</p>
<hr class='tbk477'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Fifth: The promulgation of a law according to which the
loss of nationality and the confiscation of property may be
pronounced against any Danish subject who has been guilty
of grave offenses abroad against the interests of Denmark,
or against the provisions laid down by the Danish Government.</p>
<hr class='tbk478'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Sixth: M. De Kauffmann is to be brought to trial for the
crime of high treason, by virtue of Article 98 of the penal
code, and of Article 3, Section 3, of the law of 18 January
1941, and to lose his nationality in conformity with a law
to be promulgated, as mentioned under Paragraph 5.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that this very characteristic example shows how the
sovereignty of the legitimate Danish Government was violated by
the Germans. They gave orders in the sphere of international
relations, although liberty in this sphere constitutes the essential
attribute of the sovereignty and the independence of the State.
They even go so far, as the Tribunal has seen in the last two paragraphs,
as to demand that a law be passed in accordance with their
wishes and that a prosecution for high treason be made in conformity
with such law, on the supposition that it will be promulgated
at their instance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To conclude the subject, I should like to read a passage from the
Danish Government report which appears in the second supplementary
memorandum on Page 4, the third book in the green file:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the month of October there occurred a sudden crisis. The
Germans claimed that His Majesty, the King, had offended
Hitler by giving too short a reply to a telegram which the
latter had sent to him. The Germans reacted abruptly and
with extreme violence. The German Minister in Copenhagen
was immediately recalled. The Danish Minister in Berlin was
then recalled to Denmark. Minister Von Renthe-Fink was
replaced by Dr. Best, who arrived in the country with the
title of Plenipotentiary of the German Reich and who brought
with him sweeping demands on the part of the German Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Von Ribbentrop, including a demand
for a change in the Danish Government and the admission of
National Socialists into the Government. These demands were
refused by Denmark and, the government having dragged
out the matter, they were finally abandoned by Dr. Best.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This may be a convenient time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 4 February 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Court, I desire to announce that
the Defendant Kaltenbrunner will be absent from this morning’s
session on account of illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: May it please the Tribunal, Mr. Dodd would like to
give some explanations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: May it please the Court, with reference to the prospective
witness Pfaffenberger, over the weekend it occurred to us,
after talking with him, that perhaps if Defense Counsel had an
opportunity to talk to him we might save some time for the Court.
Accordingly we made this Witness available to Dr. Kauffmann for
conversation and interview; he has talked with him as long as he
has pleased, and has notified us that in view of this conversation
he does not care to cross-examine him, and as well other Counsel
for the Defense have no desire to cross-examine him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness Pfaffenberger can be
released?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: That is what we would like to do, at the order of
the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Gentlemen, during the last session I reached the end
of the first period of the German occupation of Denmark. In connection
with that first period I should like still to mention a circumstance
which is established by the Danish report, Document
Number RF-901, second memorandum, Page 4. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the German aggression against Russia took place on
22 June 1941”—that is the third book of the report—“one of
the most serious encroachments was made on the political
liberties which the Germans had promised to respect. They
forcibly obliged the government to intern the Communists,
the total number of which was 300.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The explanations which I gave in the previous session related to
the improper interference on the part of the first instrument of
German usurpation, the diplomatic representation.
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The second instrument of German interference was, as might be
expected, the local National Socialist Party of Fritz Clausen, about
which I spoke previously. The Germans hoped that in the favorable
circumstances of the occupation, and thanks to the support they
would bring to it, this party might develop enormously. But their
calculations were completely wrong. In effect, in March 1943 elections
took place in Denmark; and these elections resulted in the
total defeat of the Nazi Party. This party obtained only a proportion
which represented 2.5 percent of the votes, and it obtained
only 3 seats out of 149 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. I point
out to the Tribunal that in some copies of my brief there is a
printing mistake and that 25 percent is indicated instead of 2.5 percent,
which is the correct figure and which shows what very little
success the Clausen party had at the elections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conduct of the Germans in Denmark showed a notable
change in the period following the month of August 1943. The first
reason for this change was clearly the failure of the plan which
consisted in seizing power in a legal manner, thanks to the aid
of the Clausen party. On the other hand, about the same time, the
Germans were equally disappointed in another direction. They had
sought, as has been shown in my brief on economic questions, to
mobilize Danish economy for the benefit of their war effort. But
the Danish population, which had refused political nazification, did
not wish to lend itself to economic nazification either. And so the
Danish industries and the Danish workmen offered passive resistance,
and by a legitimate reaction against the irregular undertakings
of the occupying power they organized a sabotage program.
There were strikes accompanied by various incidents. Faced with
this double failure, the Germans decided to modify their tactics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection we read in the government report, Page 6 of
the second memorandum, the following sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“As a result of these events, the Plenipotentiary of the German
Reich, Dr. Best, was on 24 August 1943, called to Berlin,
from whence he returned with claims in the nature of an
ultimatum addressed to the Danish Government.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I should now like to submit the text of this ultimatum, which
is also to be found in the official Danish report. This is Appendix
Number 2 of this report. The ultimatum is dated Copenhagen,
28 August 1943. At the end of the first three books there are
several loose sheets which are the appendices. I now come to the
second appendix—on Saturday I read the first appendix—which is
the second sheet and it has also been copied in my brief:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Claims of the Reich Government:</p>
<hr class='tbk479'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Danish Government must immediately declare the
entire country in a state of military emergency.
<span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk480'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The state of military emergency must include the following
measures:</p>
<hr class='tbk481'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Prohibition of public gatherings of more than five persons.</p>
<hr class='tbk482'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. Prohibition of all strikes and of any aid given to strikers.</p>
<hr class='tbk483'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. Prohibition of all meetings in closed premises or in the
open air; prohibition to be in the streets between 2030 hours
and 0530 hours; closing of restaurants at 1930 hours. By
1 September 1943 all firearms and explosives to be handed
over.</p>
<hr class='tbk484'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. Prohibition to hamper in any way whatsoever Danish
nationals because of their collaboration or the collaboration
of their relatives with the German authorities, or because of
their relations with the Germans.</p>
<hr class='tbk485'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Establishment of a press censorship with German collaboration.</p>
<hr class='tbk486'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. Establishment of courts-martial to judge acts contravening
the measures taken to maintain order and security.</p>
<hr class='tbk487'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Infringement of the measures mentioned above will be
punished by the most severe penalties which can be imposed
in conformity with the law in force concerning the power of
the Government to take measures to maintain calm, order,
and security. The death penalty must be introduced without
delay for acts of sabotage and for any aid given in committing
these acts, for attacks against the German forces, for possession
after 1 September 1943 of firearms and explosives.</p>
<hr class='tbk488'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Government expects to receive today before.
1600 hours the acceptance by the Danish Government of the
above-mentioned demands.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Danish Government, mindful of its dignity, courageously
refused to yield to that ultimatum, although it found itself under
the material constraint of the military occupation. Direct encroachments
upon the sovereignty then started. The Germans themselves
took the measures which they had not succeeded in getting the
national government to accept. They declared a state of military
emergency; they took hostages; they attacked without warning,
which is contrary to the laws of war; and at a time when—let me
recall it—a state of war did not exist, they attacked the Danish
Army and Navy and disarmed and imprisoned their forces. They
pronounced death sentences and deported a certain number of persons
considered to be Communists and whose internment, as I
pointed out, they had previously required. From 29 August 1943,
the King, the Government, and the Parliament ceased to exercise
their functions. The administration continued under the direction
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>
of high officials who in urgent cases took measures called, “Emergency
Laws.” During this same period there existed three German
authorities in Denmark:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the Plenipotentiary, who was still Dr. Best; second, the
military authority under the orders of General Hannecken, replaced
subsequently by General Lindemann; and third, the German police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, the German police were installed in Denmark a few
days after the crisis of which I have just spoken to you. The SS
Standartenführer, Colonel Dr. Mildner, arrived in September as
Chief of the German Security; and on 1 November there arrived
in Denmark as the Supreme Chief of the Police, the Obergruppenführer
and Lieutenant General of the Police, Günther Pancke, of
whom I shall have occasion to speak again. General of Police
Günther Pancke had under his authority Dr. Mildner, whose name
I mentioned at first and who was replaced on 5 January 1944 by
SS Standartenführer Bovensiepen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will find in the Danish Government’s report, on
which I base this information, a chart showing the German officials
in Denmark. This chart is to be found in the second memorandum,
Page 2. It is interesting, although we are not concerned here with
individual cases, insofar as it shows the organization of the German
network in this country. During the whole period which I am
speaking about now, of the three German authorities already mentioned,
the police played the most important role and was the principal
organ of usurpation of sovereignty by the Germans. For
that reason we might consider that while Norway and Holland
represent cases of civil administration and Belgium and France
represent cases of military administration, Denmark represents the
typical case of police administration. At the same time we must
never forget that these different types of administration in all these
occupied countries were always interdependent. The seizure of
authority by the German police in Denmark during the period from
September 1943 until the liberation was responsible for an extraordinary
number of crimes. Unlike other administrations, the police
did not act under legal or statutory regulations, but it interfered
very effectually in the life of the country by the exercise of orderly
and systematic <span class='it'>de facto law</span>. I shall have the opportunity of treating
certain aspects of this police administration in the fourth section
of my brief. For the moment, within the scope of my subject, I
should like simply to cite the facts which constitute direct and
general violation of sovereignty. In this connection, I believe that
it is indispensable that I inform the Tribunal of a quite exceptional
event which took place on 19 September 1944. At that date the
Germans suppressed the police—I mean the national police of Denmark—and
totally abolished this same institution which is naturally
indispensable and essential in all states.
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I am going to read on this point what the government report
says, second memorandum, that is to say, still the third book of the
file, Page 29. I shall begin in the middle of the paragraph, after the
first sentence. The extract is to be found in my brief. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fact that the Germans had not succeeded in exerting
any influence among the Danish police or among their leaders
or in the ranks, was partly the reason why the German military
authorities at the end of the summer of 1944 began to fear the
police. Pancke explained that General Hannecken himself
was afraid that the police, numbering 8,000 to 10,000 well-trained
men, might fall upon the Germans in the event of an
invasion. In September 1944, believing that an invasion of
Denmark was probable, Pancke and Hannecken planned the
disarming of the police and the deportation of a part of it.
Pancke submitted the plan to Himmler, who consented to it
in writing, adding in the letter that the plan had been approved
by Hitler. He had moreover discussed the plan with
Kaltenbrunner. The operation was carried out by Pancke and
Bovensiepen, who had discussed the plan with Kaltenbrunner
and Müller of the RSHA, and the regular troops aided this
operation with the consent of General Hannecken.</p>
<hr class='tbk489'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At 11 o’clock in the morning of 19 September 1944 the
Germans caused a false air-raid alarm to be given. Immediately
afterwards, the police soldiers forcibly entered the
police headquarters in Copenhagen as well as the police
stations in the city. Some policemen were killed. They acted
in the same way throughout the whole country. Most of the
policemen on duty were captured. In Copenhagen and in the
large cities of the country the prisoners were taken to Germany
in ships, which Kaltenbrunner had sent for this purpose,
or in box cars. As has already been said before, the treatment
to which they were subjected in German concentration camps
was horrible beyond description. In the small country towns
the policemen were freed.</p>
<hr class='tbk490'/>
<p class='noindent'>“At the same time Pancke decreed what he called a state of
police emergency. The exact meaning of this expression has
never been explained, and even the Germans do not seem to
have understood what it meant. In practice, the result was
that all police activities, ordinary as well as judicial, were
suspended. Maintenance of order and public security was left
to the inhabitants themselves.</p>
<hr class='tbk491'/>
<p class='noindent'>“During the last 6 months of the occupation, the Danish
nation found itself in the unheard-of situation, unknown in
other civilized countries, of being deprived of its police force
and the possibility to maintain order and public security. This
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span>
state of affairs might have ended in complete chaos if the
respect for the law and the discipline of the population,
strengthened by the indignation at this act of violence, had
not warded off the most serious consequences.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the bearing of the Danish population, the absence of
the police during these last 6 months of the occupation naturally
resulted in a recrudescence of all forms of criminality. You can
get an idea of this if you consider—and that detail will suffice—that
the premiums of insurance companies had to be raised to 480 percent—it
says so in the report—whereas previously they were limited
to half of the normal rate. We are justified in considering that the
crimes committed under these conditions involved the responsibility
of the German authorities who could not fail to foresee and who
accepted this state of affairs. We see here further proof of the total
indifference of the Germans to the consequences arising from
decisions taken by them to suit their ends at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I should like to conclude this section on Denmark by
quoting to the Tribunal a passage from a document which I shall
present as Exhibit Number RF-902. This document belongs to the
American documentation under the Number 705-PS, but it has not
yet been submitted, and I should like to read an extract, one quotation,
which seems to me to be interesting. This is a report drawn
up in Berlin on 12 January 1943, and concerns a meeting of the SS
Committee of the Research Institute for Germanic Regions (Ausschuss
der Arbeitsgemeinschaft für den Germanischen Raum). At
this meeting there were present 14 personages of the SS. This report
contains a special paragraph which concerns Denmark. Other paragraphs
of the same document are of interest in connection with the
section which will follow this. Therefore, in order to avoid having
to refer to this document twice, I shall read the whole of the
passages which I should like to submit as evidence. I start on Page 3
of the document, towards the end of the page.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Norway. In Norway the Minister Fuglesang meanwhile has
become the successor to the Minister Lunde, who has been
killed in an accident. Despite the promises made by Quisling’s
party, Norway may not be expected to furnish an important
quota.</p>
<hr class='tbk492'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Denmark. In Denmark the situation is extremely encouraging
on account of the taking over of power by SS Gruppenführer
Dr. Best. We may be convinced that the SS Gruppenführer
Dr. Best will furnish a classical example of the ethnical policy
of the Reich. The relations with the Party Leader Clausen
have recently become difficult. Clausen agreed only to the
project for the establishment of a Front Combatant Corps
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>
as a preliminary to the Germanic Schutzstaffel in Denmark,
on the condition that members of this corps will be barred
from membership to the Party. Negotiations about this
urgently needed central organization of front combatants are
going on. The monopoly of the Party is untenable; all rejuvenating
elements must be mobilized although Clausen personally
has to stand in the foreground but without his clique.</p>
<hr class='tbk493'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Netherlands. In the Netherlands Mussert has in the meantime
been proclaimed Führer of the Dutch people by the Reich
Commissioner, Seyss-Inquart. This measure has produced an
extremely disquieting effect in other Germanic countries,
particularly in Flanders. The decisive role again falls to the
General Commissioner whose principle of exploiting Mussert
and then dropping him cannot be accepted under a Germanic
Reich policy as approved by the SS.</p>
<hr class='tbk494'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Flanders: In Flanders the development of the VNV (the
Flemish National Movement) continues to be unfavorable.
Even the shrewd policy of the new leader of the VNV, Dr.
Elias, can no longer deceive us about this. Besides, he once
expressed the opinion that Germany was prepared to make
concessions in ethnological policy only when she was in bad
straits.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This information is quite characteristic. In the first place, it is
firmly established that the Germanic regions should include Norway,
Denmark, the Netherlands, and Flanders. Naturally I speak only
of the western countries. In the second place, we clearly see how
the Germans used the Nazi-inspired local parties as an instrument
for the usurpation of sovereignty. In the third place, we see it is
quite true that the German diplomatic agents were also instruments
for this policy of usurpation and completely exceeded their normal
functions. In the fourth place, the document confirms the interdependence
which existed between the different agents of German
interference, which we stressed a short time ago and on which we
cannot lay too much emphasis. The case of Dr. Best is a good
example. Dr. Best was a minister with plenipotentiary powers;
therefore, he was a diplomatic agent. We have seen that this same
Dr. Best was previously an agent of the military administration in
France, and we see by this document that besides his being a Plenipotentiary
Minister he is a General in the SS, and in this capacity,
so the document states, he seized power in Denmark. The information
contained in the document concerning Norway and the
Netherlands is a transition for the following part of this section,
and I ask the Tribunal to take the file entitled, “Norway and the
Netherlands.”
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The institution of Reich Commissioner was applied in Norway
and in the Netherlands, and in these two countries only; it constitutes
a definite concept in the general plan of Germanization, in
which these two countries occupy parallel positions. In both cases
the establishment of the civil administration followed hard upon the
military occupation of the country. The military men, therefore,
did not have to take over the administration, and during the few
days which preceded the appointment of the Reich Commissioner,
they confined themselves to measures concerning order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Norway the decree of 24 April 1940 appointed Terboven as
Reich Commissioner. This decree is signed by Hitler, Lammers, and
the Defendants Keitel and Frick. In Holland the decree of 18 May
1940 appointed the Defendant Seyss-Inquart as Reich Commissioner.
This decree is signed by the same persons as the preceding decree,
and it bears in addition the signatures of Göring and Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decrees appointing the Reich-Commissioners also defined
their functions as well as the division of the functions between the
civil commissioner and the military authorities. I am not submitting
these two decrees as documents since they are direct acts of German
legislation. The decree concerning Norway provides in its first
article:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Commissioner has the task of safeguarding the
interests of the Reich, and of exercising supreme power in the
civil domain.”—The decree adds—“The Reich Commissioner
is directly under me and receives from me directives and
instructions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the division of functions is concerned, I give the text of
Article 4, “The Commander of the German troops in Norway exercises
the rights of military sovereignty. His orders are carried out
in the civil domain by the Reich Commissioner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This decree was published in the <span class='it'>Official Gazette of German
Decrees</span> for 1940, Number 1. The same instructions are given in a
similar decree of 18 May 1940 concerning the Netherlands. The
establishment of Reich-Commissioners was accompanied at the beginning
by some pronouncement intended to reassure the population.
Terboven proclaimed that he intended to limit, as much as possible,
the inconveniences and costs of the occupation. This is in a proclamation
of 25 April 1940 which is in the <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>, Page 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Likewise, after his appointment, the Defendant Seyss-Inquart
addressed an appeal to the Dutch people. This is to be found in the
<span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for Holland for 1940, Page 2, and in it he expressed
himself as follows—he starts off with a categorical phrase:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I shall take all measures, including those of a legislative
nature, which will be necessary for carrying out this mandate”—and
he says also—“it is my will that the laws in force
<span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span>
up to now shall remain in force and that the Dutch authorities
shall be associated with the carrying out of government
affairs and that the independence of justice be maintained.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But these promises were not kept. It is evident that the Reich
Commissioner was to become in Norway and in Holland the principal
instrument for the usurpation of sovereignty. He was to act,
however, in close relation with a second instrument of usurpation,
the National Socialist organization in the country. This collaboration
of the local Nazi Party with the German authority, represented by
the Reich Commissioner, took perceptibly different forms in each of
the two countries under consideration. Thus, the exercise of power
by the Reich Commissioner presents in itself differences between
Norway and Holland which were more apparent than real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In both countries the local National Socialist Party existed before
the war. It grew and was inspired by the German Nazi Party and
had its place in the general plan of war preparations and the plan
for Germanization. I should like to give some information concerning
Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialist Party was called “Nasjonal Samling.” It
had as leader the famous Quisling. It was a perfect imitation of the
German Nazi Party. I submit to the Tribunal as Document Number
RF-920, the text of the oath of fidelity subscribed to by members of
this Nasjonal Samling Party. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My pledge of allegiance: I promise on my honor:</p>
<hr class='tbk495'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. Unflinching allegiance and loyalty towards the National
Socialist movement, its idea, and its Führer.”—This is the
third page of the Document RF-920.</p>
<hr class='tbk496'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. To stand up energetically and fearlessly for the cause,
always to offer reliability and loyal discipline at my work,
and to do all I can in order to acquire the knowledge and
abilities which my work for the Movement demands.</p>
<hr class='tbk497'/>
<p class='noindent'>“3. To the best of my abilities to live in compliance with the
National Socialist concept and to show solidarity, understanding,
and good comradeship to all my companions.</p>
<hr class='tbk498'/>
<p class='noindent'>“4. To obey any orders given by the Führer or by his appointed
officials insofar as such orders are not in disagreement
or do not violate the directions of the Führer.</p>
<hr class='tbk499'/>
<p class='noindent'>“5. Never to reveal to unauthorized persons details of NS
methods of work or anything detrimental to the Movement.</p>
<hr class='tbk500'/>
<p class='noindent'>“6. At all times to make the utmost effort to contribute to the
progress of the Movement, and to the achievement of its purpose,
and to play the part in the fighting organization which
I have undertaken to do under promise of fidelity, quite
<span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span>
conscious that I should be guilty of an unworthy and vile act
if I broke this promise.</p>
<hr class='tbk501'/>
<p class='noindent'>“7. If circumstances should make it impossible for me to continue
as a member of the fighting organization, I promise to
withdraw in a loyal manner. I shall remain bound by the
vow of secrecy which I made and I shall do nothing to harm
the Movement.</p>
<hr class='tbk502'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Our aim. The aim of the Nasjonal Samling is: A new state,
a Norwegian and Nordic fellowship within the world community,
organically constructed on the basis of work, with
a strong and stable administration, a combination of common
and private weal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This party therefore conforms completely to the Leadership
Principle and while it shows a Norwegian facade, it is nothing but
a facade. In fact on the very day of the invasion the Nazis imposed
the establishment of an alleged Norwegian Government, presided
over by Quisling. At that time the Norwegian Supreme Court
appointed a board of officials who were to be invested, under the
title of Administrative Council, with powers of higher administration.
This Administrative Council constituted therefore, in the
exceptional circumstances in which it was set up, a qualified
authority for representing the legitimate sovereignty, at least in a
conservative way. It functioned only for a short time. By September
the Nazis found that it was not possible for them to obtain the
participation or even passive acceptance of the Administrative
Council and of the administrators. They themselves then appointed
13 commissioners, of whom 10 were selected among the members
of the Quisling party. Quisling himself did not exercise any
nominal function, but he remained the Führer of his party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, a third period began on 1 February 1942. At that date
Quisling returned to power as Minister President, and the commissioners
themselves assumed the title of ministers. This situation
lasted until the liberation of Norway. Thus, except for a few months
in 1940, the Germans completely usurped all sovereignty in Norway.
This sovereignty was divided between their direct agent, the
Reich Commissioner, and their indirect agents, first called State
Councillors and then the Quisling Government, but always an
emanation of National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no doubt whatever that the independence of these
organizations vis-à-vis the German authorities was absolutely nil.
The fact that the second organization was called a government did
not mean a strengthening of its autonomous authority. These were
merely differences of form, the nature of which I shall point out to
the Tribunal. I submit, in this connection, two documents, Documents
RF-921 and RF-922. By comparing these two documents you will
<span class='pageno' title='515' id='Page_515'></span>
see that what I have just affirmed is correct. These two documents
are instructions addressed by the Reich Commissioner to his offices
concerned with legislative procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number RF-921 is dated 10 October 1940; that is the
very beginning of the period of the State Councillors. I quote an
extract from this document, “All the decrees of the State Councillors
must be submitted to the Reich Commissioner before publication.”
This is to be found in the second paragraph. It is the only point
which I should like to bring out in this document. Therefore all the
decrees of the higher Norwegian administration were under the
control of the Reich Commissioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second document, Document Number RF-922, is dated
8 April 1942. It relates to the period shortly after the establishment
of the second Quisling Government. I start at the second sentence
of this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of the formation of the National Norwegian Government
on 1 February 1942 the Reich Commissioner has decided
that from now on this form of agreement”—a prior agreement
in writing—“is no longer required. Nevertheless, this modification
of formal legislative procedure does not mean that the
Norwegian Government may proclaim laws and decrees
without the knowledge of the competent department of the
Reich Commissioner. His Excellency, the Reich Commissioner,
expects every department chief to acquaint himself, by close
contact with the competent Norwegian departments, with all
legislative measures which are in preparation, and to find
out in each case whether these measures concern German
interests, and to assure himself, if necessary, that German
interests will be taken into consideration.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in the one case, there is a formal control with written
authorization. In the other case there is a control by information
among the different departments, but the principle is the same. The
establishment of local authority under one form or under another
form was merely a means of finding out the best way of deceiving
public opinion. When the Germans put Quisling into the background,
it was because they thought the State Councillors, being
less well-known, might more easily deceive the public. When they
returned Quisling, it was because the first maneuver had obviously
failed and because they thought that perhaps the official establishment
of an authority qualified as governmental would give the
impression that the sovereignty of the country had not been
abolished. One might, however, wonder what was the reason for
these artifices and why the Nazis used them, instead of purely and
simply annexing the country. There is a very important reason for
that. It operates for Norway and it will operate for the Netherlands.
<span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span>
The Nazis always preferred to maintain the fiction of an independent
state and to gain a definite hold from within by using and developing
the local Party. It is with this end in view that they granted
the Party in Norway advantages of prestige; and if they did not act
in an identical manner in Holland, their general conduct was,
however, imbued with the same spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This policy of the Germans in Norway is perfectly illustrated by
the Norwegian law, or so-called Norwegian law, of 12 March 1942,
(Norwegian <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>, 1942, Page 215, which I offer in evidence
as Document Number RF-923). I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Law concerning the Party and the State, 12 March 1942,
Number 2.</p>
<hr class='tbk503'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph 1. In Norway the Nasjonal Samling is the fundamental
party of the State and closely linked with the State.</p>
<hr class='tbk504'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph 2. The organization of the Party, its activity, and
the duties of its members are laid down by the Führer of the
Nasjonal Samling.</p>
<hr class='tbk505'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Oslo, 12 March 1942”—signed—“Quisling, Minister President.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, the Nazis organized on a large scale the
system of the duplication of functions which existed among the
higher authorities. In fact, it is the transposition of the German
system, which shows a constant parallelism between the state administration
and the party organizations. Everywhere German Nazis
were installed to second and supervise the Norwegian Nazis who
had been put in official positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this point is interesting from the point of view of seizure of
sovereignty and of action taken in the administration, I think I may
submit two documents, which are Documents RF-924 and RF-925.
These are extracts of judicial interrogations by the Norwegian Court
of two high German officials of the Reich Commission at Oslo.
Document Number RF-924 refers to the interrogation of Georg Wilhelm
Müller, interrogation dated 5 January 1946. Wilhelm Müller
was the Ministerial Director in the Ministry for Public Enlightenment
and Propaganda. The information which he gives concerns
more particularly the functioning of the propaganda service, but
similar methods were used in a general way, as this statement
admits. I quote Document RF-924:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘In 1941 nobody in your country thought that
military difficulties would arise. At that time they certainly
tried to mold the Norwegian people along Nationalist Socialist
lines?’</p>
<hr class='tbk506'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘They did this until the very end.’</p>
<hr class='tbk507'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Which were the practical measures for achieving
this National Socialist molding?’
<span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk508'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘They supported the NS Samling as far as possible;
and they did it, in the first place, by strengthening the Party
organization considerably.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I may point out that this translation into French is not first rate; it
is, however, comprehensible.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘In what way was it strengthened?’</p>
<hr class='tbk509'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘In each Fylke’—or province—‘picked German
National Socialists were assigned to aid the Norwegian
National Socialists.’</p>
<hr class='tbk510'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Were there other practical measures?’</p>
<hr class='tbk511'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘That was done in all domains, even in the field of
propaganda, by the Einsatzstab propagandists placed at their
disposal. This was also done in Oslo at the central offices of
the NS Samling.’</p>
<hr class='tbk512'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘How did these propagandists work?’</p>
<hr class='tbk513'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘They worked closely with similar Norwegian propagandists
and made suggestions to them. Grebe did this by
virtue of his double capacity as Chief of Propaganda in the
Reichskommissariat and Chief of the Landesgruppe.’</p>
<hr class='tbk514'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘How was this done?’</p>
<hr class='tbk515'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘These consultations and conferences were even
arranged for the very top of the Party hierarchy. There was
a man who was specially appointed for this; first Wegeler,
then Neumann, then Schnurbusch, who had the task of
strengthening National Socialist ideas within the NS Samling.’</p>
<hr class='tbk516'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘In the Einsatzstab there were experts from the
different branches whose task it was to contact Norwegians
and give them useful advice. In what domains?’</p>
<hr class='tbk517'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘There were organizers, and above all instructors
for the Hird, leaders of the SA and SS. Until he, himself,
became leader of the Einsatzstab, we had at the head a press
man, a propagandist, Herr Schnurbusch, an accountant, an
expert on social welfare questions in the same way as in the
NSV in Germany.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will notice in this document the name of Schnurbusch,
as being that of the leader of the Einsatzstab, and of the
organism for liaison with, and penetration into, the local Party.
I am now going to quote an extract from the interrogation of
Schnurbusch, which is found in Document Number RF-925.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you putting these documents in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you say, for the purposes of the shorthand
note, that you offer them in evidence?
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Will you excuse me? I should like to point out that
I submit as evidence Document Number RF-925 as well as Document
Number RF-924 of which I spoke just now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is from the interrogation of Heinrich Schnurbusch, leader of
the liaison service in the Reich Commission on 8 January 1946 in
Oslo:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘How did the German departments try to achieve
this National Socialist conversion?’</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I wish to point out to the Tribunal that I have passed over the
first three questions as they are not of much interest.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘We sought to strengthen this movement by the
means which we were accustomed to apply in Germany for
leading the masses. The Nasjonal Samling benefited by having
at their disposal all the means of news service and propaganda.
But we soon saw that the object could not be
achieved. After 25 September 1940 the public mood in Norway
changed suddenly when some State Councillors were appointed
as NS State Councillors, for Quisling’s action in the days of
April 1940 was considered treason by the Norwegian people.’</p>
<hr class='tbk518'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘In what way did you assist materially the NS
Samling in this propaganda? In what way did you counsel the
NS Samling?’</p>
<hr class='tbk519'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘During the time I was in office, when a propaganda
drive was made, it was always brought into line with the
propaganda which the Germans made in Norway.’</p>
<hr class='tbk520'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Did you issue any directives for the NS Samling?’</p>
<hr class='tbk521'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘No. In my time the NS Samling worked independently
in this respect, and partly even contrary to our advice.
The NS Samling took the view that it understood better the
Norwegian mentality, but it made many mistakes.’</p>
<hr class='tbk522'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Question: ‘Was financial support given?’</p>
<hr class='tbk523'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Answer: ‘Certainly, financial help was given, but I don’t
know the exact amount.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Shall we adjourn for 10 minutes?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I should like first of all to point out to the Tribunal
that, with its permission, I shall examine this afternoon the Witness
Van der Essen concerning whom a formal request has already been
submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, M. Faure.
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: This witness can then be called at the beginning of
the afternoon session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The observations which I have just presented had to do with
Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Netherlands, unlike what happened in Norway, the Nazis
did not utilize the local Party as an official instrument of government.
The governmental authority was completely in the hands of
the Reich Commissioner who set up a sort of ministry, including
four German General Commissioners, respectively competent for
government and justice, public security, finance, and economic
affairs, and special affairs. This organization was created by a
decree of 3 June 1940 (<span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for Holland, 1940, Number 5).
I point out that, as the Dutch <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> has already been
submitted in evidence to the Tribunal, I shall not again submit each
of these texts, which are a part of it. I shall, therefore, simply ask
the Tribunal to take judicial notice of them and to consider them as
proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The holders of the posts of General Commissioners were appointed
by the decree of 5 June 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The local authorities were represented at the higher level only
by the Secretaries General of the Ministries, who were entirely
under the authority of the Reich Commissioner and of the General
Commissioners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decree of 29 May 1940, which is in the Dutch <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>,
1940, Page 8, lays down in its first article:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Commissioner will exercise the powers invested
until now in the King and the Government.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And in Article 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Secretaries General of the Dutch ministries are responsible
to the Reich Commissioner.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>If the Nazi Party did not constitute the Government, it nevertheless
received the official blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall quote to the Tribunal in this connection the decree of
30 January 1943, which likewise is in the Dutch <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>,
1943, Page 63. I read the following passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The representative of the political will of the Dutch people
is the National Socialist movement of the Netherlands. I have,
therefore, decreed that all the German offices under my
orders, of the administration and those of the National Socialist
movement, shall maintain close contact with the leader
of the Movement in order to assure the co-ordination of the
tasks in carrying out important administrative measures and
particularly for all matters concerning personnel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal knows already, for it is common knowledge, and
insofar as it might be necessary through the witness who has already
been heard, how outrageously untrue it was to claim that the Dutch
National Socialist Party represented the political will of the people
of this country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having commented on these two forms of utilization of the local
party as agents of sovereignty, I should now like to point out to the
Tribunal the main features of these usurpations which were committed
by the Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A first line of action is exemplified by the attempt to induce the
occupied countries to participate in the war or, at the very least, to
initiate recruitment for the German Army. In Norway the Nazis
created the “SS Norge,” a formation which later was called the
“Germanske SS Norge.” I submit as evidence Document Number
RF-926, which is the decree of 21 July 1942, concerning the “Germanske
SS Norge,” and I quote Paragraph 2 of this decree, which is
a Quisling decree.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“2. ‘The Germanske SS Norge’ is a National Socialist order of
soldiers which shall consist of men of Nordic blood and ideas.
It is an independent subdivision of the Nasjonal Samling,
directly under the NS Foerer (NS Leader) and responsible to
him. It is, at the same time, a section of the ‘Stor-Germanske
SS’ ”—the SS of Greater Germany—“and shall help to lead
the Germanic peoples towards a new future and create the
basis of a Germanic fellowship.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We see again, by this example, that the interventions of the so-called
Norwegian Government are perfectly obvious methods of
Germanization. In order to facilitate the recruiting into this legion,
the German or Norwegian Nazis did not hesitate to upset the civil
legislation and to abolish the abiding principles of family rights by
making a law which exempted minors from having to obtain the
consent of their parents. This is a law of 1 February 1941, Norwegian
<span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>, 1941, Page 153, which I submit in evidence
as Document Number RF-927.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Netherlands the Germans were obliged to upset even
more the national legislation in order to permit military recruitment.
As they did not create a factitious government and as the
legitimate government was still at war with the Reich, the volunteers
came under Articles 101 and the following articles of the Dutch
penal code, which punished those enlisted in the army of a foreign
power at war with the Netherlands and likewise those who give aid
to the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By reason of the <span class='it'>de facto</span> occupation of the country there was
little chance of these penalties being effectively applied, but it is
very curious and very revealing that the Reich Commissioner
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>
issued a decree of 25 July 1941, Dutch <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>, 1941, Number
135. This decree states that the taking of Dutchmen for service
in the German Army, the Waffen SS, or the Legion of Netherlands
Volunteers does not bring them under the provisions of the penal
texts mentioned above, and this decree is declared retroactive to
10 May 1940. It is therefore very convenient, when one commits a
criminal act according to the general code, to be able to modify
the law to suppress the crime in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another decree of 25 July 1941, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1941, Page
548, stipulates that enrollment in the German Army will no longer
involve loss of Dutch nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, a decree of 8 August 1941, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1941,
Page 622, declares that the acquisition of German nationality no
longer entails the loss of Dutch nationality except in cases of
express renunciation. Although this last text seems to bring out a
point of detail, it may be regarded as an initial attempt to create
later a double Dutch and German nationality, which will fit into
the general procedures for the advancement of the whole plan of
Germanization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In regard to these measures for military recruitment, I should
like to state precisely the attitude of the Prosecution as a result of
the examination and cross-examination of the witness, Vorrink,
who was heard on Saturday. The Prosecution does not consider
that the criminal character of this military recruitment is established
only by the fact of having recruited persons by force or by
pressure upon their will. This pressure and this constraint are an
aggravating and characteristic aspect but not a necessary aspect of the
criminal action which we reprehend. The fact of having recruited
persons, even on a voluntary basis, in the occupied countries for
service in the German Army, is considered by us as a crime. This
crime is moreover punishable under the internal legislation of all
these countries, whose legislation covers such acts as those committed
in these countries, in accordance with the rules of law in
matters of legislative competence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is even relatively of small importance, except for knowing all
the details, whether the recruiting of traitors was favored or not by
particular pressure according to the situation in which these traitors
found themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like also to indicate in a more general way, that the
Prosecution does not consider that the recruiting of traitors, either
for service in the Army or in other activities, is for the Nazi leaders
an extenuating circumstance or an exonerating one. On the contrary,
it is one of the characteristics of their criminal activity; and
the responsibility of the traitors in no way exempts them from
<span class='pageno' title='522' id='Page_522'></span>
responsibility. On the contrary, we hold against them this corruption
which they attempted to spread in the occupied countries by
appealing to those elements of weak morality which may be found
in the population of a country and by instilling in the mind of each
person the thought of possible immoral and criminal activity against
his country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a first line of action for German usurpation: namely,
the enrollment of troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second general line of action is identified with the whole of
the measures designed to abolish civil liberties and to set up the
Leadership Principle. I shall quote some of these measures by way
of example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Norway, suppression of political parties, German decree of
25 September 1940, which is in the <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1940, Page 19;
a decree forbidding all activity in favor of the legitimate dynasty,
decree of 7 October 1940, in the <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1940, Page 10;
the guarantees under the statutory rules for officials were suppressed,
they could be transferred or dismissed for political reasons,
German decree of 4 October 1940, Page 24. Finally, a Norwegian
law of 18 September 1943, setting up a characteristic institution,
that of departmental chief representing the Party, and responsible
to the Minister President and to no other authority of the State
(Document Number RF-928). He exercised in the department the
supreme political control over all public authorities of the department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All professions came under the system of compulsory membership
with application of the Leadership Principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland we likewise observe the suppression of elected bodies,
decree of 11 August 1941, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1941, Page 637, which
confirms the decree of 21 June 1940, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1940,
Page 54; the dissolution of political parties, decree of 4 July 1941,
<span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1941, Page 583; creation of the Labor Front,
decree of 30 April 1942, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1942, Page 211; setting
up of the Peasant Corporation, decree of 22 October 1941, <span class='it'>Official
Gazette</span> for 1941, Page 838.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have given only a few examples of this principle; and to conclude
I shall quote a decree of 12 August 1941, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for
1941, Page 34, which created a special judicial competence for all
offenses and infringements committed against political peace and
against political interests, or committed for political motives. In
fact, the justices of the peace charged with exercising these oppressive
powers were always chosen from among the members of the
Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally a third line of action in this campaign of usurpation can
be defined as a systematic campaign against the elite of the country
<span class='pageno' title='523' id='Page_523'></span>
and against its spiritual life. In fact it is always in this sphere that
the Nazis met with the greatest resistance to their designs. They
attacked the universities and teaching establishments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland a decree of 25 July 1941, <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> for 1941,
Page 559, gives the administration the right to close arbitrarily all
private institutions. In the Netherlands the University of Leyden
was closed on 11 November 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a decree of the Reich Commissioner of 10 May 1943, <span class='it'>Official
Gazette</span> for 1943, Page 127, the students were forced to sign a declaration
of loyalty drawn up in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The undersigned, ——, hereby solemnly declares on
his word of honor that he will conscientiously conform to the
laws, decrees, and other dispositions in force in Dutch occupied
territory and will abstain from any act directed against
the German Reich, the German Army, or the Dutch authorities,
or engage in any activity which might imperil public
order in the higher teaching institutions in view of the present
circumstances and danger.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Norway rigorous measures were taken against the University
of Oslo. I offer in evidence Document Number RF-933. I point out
to the Tribunal that this is not in strict order and that Document
Number RF-933 is the last in the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Document Number RF-933 is an article in the <span class='it'>Deutsche
Zeitung</span> of 1 December 1943, reproduced in a Norwegian newspaper.
It is entitled, “A Cleaning-Up Measure Necessary in Oslo; Purge
in the Student World.” I shall read only a few paragraphs of this
article. I begin with the second paragraph:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The students of the University of Oslo”—will the Tribunal
excuse me. I shall read also the first paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By order of the Reich Commissioner Terboven, the SS Obergruppenführer
and General of the Police Rediess made the
following announcement to the students in the lecture room
of the University of Oslo on Tuesday afternoon:</p>
<hr class='tbk524'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The students of the University of Oslo have attempted to
offer resistance to the German Army of occupation and to
the Norwegian Government recognized by the Reich, since
the occupation of Norway, that is, since 1940.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I shall end the quotation here, and continue at Paragraph 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In order to protect the interests of the occupying power and
to assure maintenance of peace and order within this country,
rigorous measures are indispensable. Therefore, by order of
the Reich Commissioner, I have to make known to you the
following:
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk525'/>
<p class='noindent'>“1. The students of the University of Oslo will be transferred
to a special camp in Germany.</p>
<hr class='tbk526'/>
<p class='noindent'>“2. The women students will be dismissed from the University
and must return by the quickest means to their original place
of residence, where they will immediately report to the police.
Until further notice they are forbidden to leave these places
without permission from the police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I break off the quotation here and continue at the last paragraph
but one, on the second page of this Document Number RF-933:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“You ought to be thankful to the Reich Commissioner that
other much more Draconian measures are not being applied.
Moreover, thanks to this measure, most of you have been
saved from forfeiting your life and wealth in the future.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As concerns religious life, the Germans multiplied their
harassing methods. By way of example, I offer in evidence Document
Number RF-929, which I shall read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Oslo, 28 May 1941: To the Commanders of the Sipo and the
SD in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Tromosoe. Subject:
Surveillance of Religious Services during the Whitsuntide
Feasts. Incidents: none.</p>
<hr class='tbk527'/>
<p class='noindent'>“It is requested that you watch the religious services and
send in a report here on the result.</p>
<hr class='tbk528'/>
<p class='noindent'>“BDS”—commander—“of the Sipo and the SD. Oslo. Signature:
(illegible) SS Hauptsturmführer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now here is the report following this order to watch the church
services. I offer this report in evidence as Document Number
RF-930. I shall read this document, which is very short.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Trondheim, 5 June 1941.</p>
<hr class='tbk529'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The surveillance of religious services during the Whitsuntide
Feasts showed no new essential points. Domprobst Fjellbu
adheres to his provocative preaching, but so cleverly that he
is able to excuse every phrase as applied to religious subjects
and void of any political meaning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The rest of the letter is partly burned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally I should like, in order not to dwell on this matter too
long, to quote two examples which show, on the one hand, the
constant immorality of the German methods and, on the other hand,
the justified protests to which they gave rise on the part of the most
qualified authorities. The first example concerns the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dutch magistrates were roused to righteous indignation by
the German practice of arbitrary detentions in concentration camps.
They found the opportunity of making known their disapproval in
a manner which came within the normal exercise of their juridical
<span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span>
functions. Thus, in connection with a particular case, the Court of
Appeal at Leeuwarden rendered a decision of which I wish to read
an extract to the Tribunal. This is submitted as Document Number
RF-931. I shall read to you an extract from this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whereas the Court cannot declare itself in agreement in the
matter of the penalty inflicted upon the accused by the Chief
Judge and his presentation of motives, the Court is of the
opinion that this penalty should be determined as follows:</p>
<hr class='tbk530'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Whereas as regards the penalty to be inflicted:</p>
<hr class='tbk531'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The Court desires to take into account the fact that for some
time various penalties of detention inflicted by the Dutch
Judge upon delinquents of masculine sex, contrary to legal
principles and contrary to the intention of the Legislator and
of the Judge, have been executed, or are being executed in
camps in a manner which aggravates the penalty to a degree
such as it was impossible for the Judge to foresee or even
to suppose when determining the degree of the punishment.</p>
<hr class='tbk532'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Whereas the Court, taking into account the possibility of
this manner of executing the penalty to be inflicted at present,
will abstain, for conscience sake, from condemning the suspect
to a period of detention in conformity, in this case, with the
gravity of the offense committed by the defendant, because
the latter would be exposed to the possibility of an execution
of the penalty as indicated here above.</p>
<hr class='tbk533'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Whereas the Court, on the strength of this consideration,
will confine itself to condemning the suspect to a penalty of
detention to be determined hereafter, after deducting the
time spent by him in preventive detention, and the duration
of which is such that the penalty at the moment of the pronouncing
of the penalty will have almost entirely expired
during the period of preventive detention.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This example is especially interesting, because I now have to
indicate that as a result of this decision of the Court of Appeal, the
Defendant Seyss-Inquart dismissed the President of the Court by
a decree of the 9th of April 1943, which is likewise submitted in
evidence under the same document number, RF-931. These two
documents constitute a whole.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By virtue of paragraph 3 of my decree,”—<span class='it'>et cetera</span>—“I dismiss
from his office as Counsellor of the Court of Appeal at
Leeuwarden, such dismissal to take effect immediately, Doctor
of Law F.F. Viehoff.”—Signed—“Seyss-Inquart.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The second example which I give in conclusion will now be
taken from Norway. It is a solemn protest made by the Norwegian
bishops. The special occasion which called forth this protest is the
<span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span>
following: The Minister for Police had issued a decree, dated
13 December 1940, by which he arrogated to himself the right to
suppress the obligation of professional secrecy for priests and
provided that priests who refused to break the secrecy of the confession
would be subjected to imprisonment by his orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 15 January 1941, the Norwegian bishops addressed themselves
to the Ministry of Public Education and Religious Affairs,
and handed to it a memorandum. In this memorandum they made
known their protests against this extraordinary demand by the
police and at the same time they protested against other abuses;
violent acts committed by Nazi organizations, and illegal acts in
judicial matters. This protest of the Norwegian bishops is transcribed
in a pastoral letter addressed to their parishes in February
1941. I submit it as Document Number RF-932. I should like to
quote an extract from this document on Page 9, top of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The decree of the Ministry of Police, dated 13 December
1940, just published, gravely affects the mission of the priests.
According to this decree, the obligation of professional secrecy
for priests and ministers may be suppressed by the Ministry
of Police.</p>
<hr class='tbk534'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Our obligation to maintain professional secrecy is not only
established by law, but has always been a fundamental condition
for the work of the Church and of the priests in the
exercise of their care of souls and in receiving the confession
of persons in distress. It is an unalterable condition for the
work of the Church, that a person may have absolute and
unlimited confidence in the priest who is unreservedly bound
by his obligation to keep professional secrecy, as it has been
formulated in the Norwegian legislation and in the regulations
of the Church at all times and in all Christian countries.</p>
<hr class='tbk535'/>
<p class='noindent'>“To abolish this <span class='it'>Magna Charta</span> of the conscience is to strike
at the very heart of the work of the Church, which is all the
more serious because Paragraph 5 of the decree stipulates
that the Ministry of Police may imprison the priest in question,
in order to force a statement without the case having
been submitted to a tribunal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Yet all this was happening during the first year of the occupation.
Already the highest spiritual authorities of Norway found
themselves in the position of having not only to protest against a
particularly intolerable act, but also to enunciate a judgment upon
the whole of the methods of the occupation, which judgment appears
on Page 16 of the pastoral letter, and which I shall read to the
Tribunal (last paragraph):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“For this reason the bishops of the Church have placed before
the Ministry some of the acts and official proclamations about
<span class='pageno' title='527' id='Page_527'></span>
the government of society during these latter times, acts and
proclamations which the Church finds in contradiction with
the Commandments of God and which give the impression of
revolutionary conditions prevailing in the country, instead of
a state of occupation by which the laws are upheld as long
as they are not directly incompatible with this state of occupation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a very correct juridical analysis; and now, if it please
the Tribunal, I should also like to read a last sentence which preceded
this, on Page 16:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the public authority of society permits violence and
injustice and exercises pressure over souls, then the Church
becomes the guardian of consciences. A human soul is of
more importance than the whole world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now ask the Tribunal to take the file entitled “Belgium.”
I point out immediately to the Tribunal that this file does not
include any document book. This statement, which deals with very
general facts, will be supported as being evidence by the report of
the Belgian Government, which has already been submitted by my
colleagues under Document Number RF-394. The section which I
now take up is a general section concerning military administration
in two cases, in Belgium and France; and I shall begin with the file
concerning Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Belgium the usurpations of national sovereignty by the occupying
power are imputable to the military command which committed
them either by direct decrees or by injunctions to the Belgian
administrative authorities who in this case were the Secretaries
General of the Ministries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the setting up of this apparatus of usurpation I shall
read out to the Tribunal two paragraphs of the Belgian report,
Chapter 4, concerning Germanization and nazification, Page 3,
Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The legal government of Belgium, having withdrawn to
France, then to London, it was the Secretaries General of the
Ministries, that is to say, the highest officials in the hierarchic
order, who, by virtue of Article 5 of the law of 10 May 1940,
exercised within the framework of their professional activity
and in cases of urgency, all the powers of the highest
authority.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, these high officials, animated, at least during the
first months of the occupation, by the desire to keep the occupying
authorities as far removed as possible from the administration of
the country, took upon themselves governmental and administrative
powers. At the order of the Germans this administrative power
after a time became a real legislative power.
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This regime of the Secretaries General pleased the Germans who
adopted it. In appointing to these posts Belgians paid by them they
could introduce into Belgium under the appearance of legality absolutely
radical reforms, which would make of this country a
National Socialist vassal state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to note at this point that in order to strengthen
their hold on the public life through the local authorities, the Germans
did not hesitate by a decree of 14 May 1942, which is referred
to in the official report, to suppress the jurisdictional control of the
legality of the orders of the Secretaries General, which was a violation
of Article 107 of the Belgian Constitution. The Belgian report
states in the following paragraphs where the responsibility lies in
this matter of breaches of public order, and I shall quote here the
actual terms of this report on Page 4, Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In conclusion, whether the transformation of the legal
institutions be the consequence of German decrees or that of
orders emanating from the Secretaries General makes no
difference. It is the Germans who bear the responsibility for
these, the Secretaries General being in relation to them only
faithful agents for carrying out their instructions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I think that it will likewise be interesting to read the three
following paragraphs of the report, for they reveal characteristic
facts as to German methods in their seizure of sovereignty.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“If it is necessary to furnish a new argument to support this
thesis further, it is sufficient to recall that the occupying
power employed all means to introduce into the structure
which was to be transformed, from top to bottom, devoted
National Socialist agents. This was really the work of
termites.</p>
<hr class='tbk536'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The decree of 7 March 1941, under the pretext of bringing
younger men into the administration, provided for the
removal of a great number of officials. They would naturally
be replaced by Germanophiles.</p>
<hr class='tbk537'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Finally, the Germans set up at the head of the Ministry of
the Interior one of their most devoted agents, who arrogated
to himself, as we shall see subsequently, the right to designate
aldermen, permanent deputies, burgomasters, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, and
used his rights to proceed to certain appointments of district
commissioners, for instance, by putting into office tools of the
enemy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Belgian report then analyzes in a remarkably clear manner
the violations by the Germans of Belgian public order, classifying
these under two headings. The first is entitled “Modifications Made
in the Original Constitutional Structure.”
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Under this heading we find particular mention of the decree of
18 July 1940, which immediately abolished all public activity; then
a series of decrees by which the Germans suppressed the election of
aldermen and decided that these aldermen would henceforth be
designated by the central authority. This meant the overthrow of
the traditional democratic order of communal administrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same way the Germans, in violation of Article 3 of the
Belgian Constitution, ordered by the decree of 26 January 1943 the
absorption of numerous communes into great urban areas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report then mentions here the fiscal exemptions granted in
violation of the Constitution, to persons engaged in the service of
the German Army or the Waffen SS. We find here a fresh example
of the German criminal and general methods of military recruitment
in the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second heading of the report reads: “Introduction into Belgian
Public Life of New Institutions Inspired by National Socialism
and the Idea of the State.” Such institutions were, in fact, created
by the German authorities. The most remarkable are the National
Agricultural and Food Corporation and the Central Merchandise
Offices. The report analyzes the characteristics of these institutions
and proves that they aimed at destroying traditional liberties. They
were organs of totalitarian inspiration in which the Leadership
Principle was applied, as we have seen was the case in similar
institutions in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like now to read the brief but revealing conclusion of
the Belgian report on Germanization. We think that it has been
sufficiently established by the preceding statement that the Belgian
Constitution and laws were deliberately violated by the German
occupying power, and this with the purpose, not of assuring its own
security, which is obvious, but with the skillfully premeditated
intention of making of Belgium a National Socialist State and, consequently,
capable of being annexed, seeing that two nationalist states
that are neighbors must necessarily exclude each other, the stronger
absorbing the weaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This policy was carried out in violation of international laws and
customs, of the Declaration of Brussels of 1874, and of the Hague
Regulations of 1899.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not give detailed indications concerning other applications
of this usurpation in connection with Belgium, because many
indications have been furnished to the Tribunal already, notably in
the economic statement and likewise in M. Dubost’s presentation.
And, moreover, as the regime in Belgium was closely bound up
with the regime in France, the indications which I shall give in the
two other sections of my brief will relate particularly to these two
countries.
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>However, before concluding the presentation which I am now
making, I should like to mention the abuses committed by the Germans
against the universities of Belgium. We find here again the
same phenomenon of hostility—very understandable of course—on
the part of the doctrinaires and Nazi leaders against the centers of
culture; and this hostility showed itself especially with regard to
the four great Belgian universities, which have such a fine tradition
of spiritual life. I must point out to the Tribunal that the observations
which I intend to present on this point have been taken
from the appendices to the Belgian report of which I read some
extracts. I must point out that these appendices have not been
submitted as documents, although they are attached to one of these
originals, which marks their authenticity. I shall have these appendices
translated and submitted later and I shall ask the Tribunal,
therefore, to consider the indications which I shall give it as affirmations,
the proof of which will be furnished, on the one hand, by
the deposit of documents and, on the other hand, by oral evidence,
since I have called a witness on the subject of these questions. If
this method satisfies the Tribunal, and I beg to be excused for the
fact that the appendices have not been actually presented with the
document, I shall continue my statement on this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: M. Faure, what are the appendices to which
you are referring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: They are documents which are in the appendix of
the Belgian report. They are as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject matter of this report is to be found in the Belgian
report itself, which has already been submitted. On the other hand,
another copy of the same section has been established as the original
with a series of appendices. For this reason the appendices were not
translated and submitted at the same time as the main report, of
which this was only a part. They are appended notes which trace
events that occurred in university life. But, as I indicated to the
Tribunal, I propose to prove these points by the hearing of a
witness. I thought, therefore, that I could make a statement which
would constitute an affirmation of the Prosecution and on which
I would produce oral evidence. On the other hand, I shall submit
the appendices as soon as they have been translated into German,
which has not yet been done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. The Tribunal is satisfied with the course
which you propose, M. Faure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I shall mention first that in the University of Ghent
the Germans undertook special propaganda among the students,
with a view to germanizing these young generations. They utilized
for this purpose an organization called “Genter Studenten Verband,”
but their efforts to develop this organization did not achieve
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span>
the success they had hoped. They set up in this university and in
others a real espionage system under the cover of an ingenious
formula, namely, that of “invited professors,” German professors
who were supposed to have been invited and who were observers
and spies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of one of these invited professors has been found in
Belgium. This report shows the procedure adopted as well as the
complete failure of the German efforts to exert influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the universities, the Germans made arrests and deported
professors and students, and this action was resorted to particularly
when the students refused—and rightly so—to obey the German
illegal orders which compelled them to enter the labor service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the University of Brussels, it should be pointed out
that this university had been, from the beginning, provided with a
German Commissioner, and that 14 professors had been irregularly
dismissed. Later, the University of Brussels was obliged to discontinue
the courses, and this as a result of a characteristic incident:</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the occasion of the vacancy of three chairs at the university,
the Germans refused to accept the nomination of the candidates
proposed in the usual way, and decided that they would appoint
professors whose views suited them. This clearly shows the generally
applied German method of interfering in everything and
putting into office everywhere agents under their influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 22 November 1941 the German military administration notified
the President of the University of this decision. Therefore, the
university decided to go on a sort of strike and, in spite of all the
efforts of the Germans, this strike of the University of Brussels
lasted until the liberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this question of the Belgian universities, I should like now
to read something to the Tribunal. This concerns the University of
Louvain. Before reading this, I must indicate to the Tribunal the
circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans had in this university, as in the others, imposed
upon the students compulsory labor. This we already know. But
what I am going to read has to do with an additional requirement
which is altogether shocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans wished to oblige the Rector of the University,
Monseigneur Van Wayenberg, to give them a complete list with the
addresses of those students who were liable to compulsory service
and who evaded it. They wished, therefore, to impose upon the
rector an act whereby he would become an informer and this under
threat of very severe penalties. The Cardinal Archbishop of Malines
intervened on this occasion and on 4 June 1943 addressed a letter to
General Von Falkenbausen, Military Commander in Belgium. I
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span>
should like to read this letter to the Tribunal. This letter is to be
found in a book which I have here and which is published in Belgium,
entitled “Cardinal Van Roey and the German Occupation in
Belgium.” I do not submit this letter as a document. I ask the
Tribunal to consider it as a quotation from a publication. This is
what Cardinal Archbishop of Malines writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“By an oral communication, of which I have asked in vain
for the confirmation in writing, the Chief of the Military
Administration Reeder has informed me that in case Monseigneur
the Rector of the Catholic University of Louvain
should persist in refusing to furnish the list with the addresses
of the first year students, the occupying authority will take
the following measures:</p>
<hr class='tbk538'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Close down the university; forbid the students to enroll in
another university; subject all the students to forced labor in
Germany and, should they evade this measure, take reprisals
against their families.</p>
<hr class='tbk539'/>
<p class='noindent'>“This communication is all the more surprising, as a few
days previously, following a note addressed to your Excellency
by Monseigneur the Rector, the latter received from
the Kreiskommandant of Louvain a notification that the academic
authority would have no further trouble with regard to
the lists. It is true that the Chief of Military Administration
Reeder informed me that this answer was due to a misunderstanding.</p>
<hr class='tbk540'/>
<p class='noindent'>“As President of the Board of the University of Louvain, I
have informed the Belgian bishops, who make up this board,
of the serious nature of the communication which I have
received; and I have the duty to inform you, in the name of
all the bishops, that it is impossible for us to advise Monseigneur
the Rector to hand over the lists of his students, and
that we approve the passive attitude which he has observed
up to now. To furnish the lists would, in effect, imply positive
co-operation in measures which the Belgian bishops have
condemned in the pastoral letter of 15 March 1943 as being
contrary to international law, to natural rights, and to Christian
morality.</p>
<hr class='tbk541'/>
<p class='noindent'>“If the University of Louvain were subjected to sanctions
because it refuses this co-operation, we consider that it would
be punished for carrying out its duty and that however hard
and painful the difficulties it would have to undergo temporarily,
its honor at least would not be sullied. We believe,
with the famous Bishop of Milan, St. Ambrose, that honor is
above everything—‘<span class='it'>Nihil praeferandum honestati.</span>’
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk542'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Moreover, Your Excellency cannot be ignorant of the fact
that the Catholic University of Louvain is a dependency of
the Holy See. Canonically established by the Papacy, it is
under the authority and the control of the Roman Congregation
of Seminaries and Universities and it is the Holy See
which approved the appointment of Monseigneur Van Wayenberg
as Rector Magnifique of the University. If the measures
announced were to be carried out, it would constitute a violent
attack on the rights of the Holy See. Consequently His
Holiness the Pope will be informed of the extreme dangers
which threaten our Catholic University.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall end here the quotation of the letter, but I must point out
to the Tribunal that in spite of this protest and any considerations
of simple practical interest, which the Germans might have had in
maintaining correct attitude in this matter, the Rector Magnifique
was arrested on 5 June 1943, and was condemned by the German
military court to 18 months imprisonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having recalled the painful facts which the Tribunal has just
heard, I should like to observe that they might almost give us the
impression that such an event as the arrest and sentence of a prelate,
rector of a university, for a wrongful reason was, since there were
no tragic consequences, of relatively secondary importance. But I
think we should not subordinate our intellectual judgment to the
direct test of our sensibility, now grown so accustomed to horrors;
and if we reflect upon it, we consider that such an outrage is in
itself very characteristic, and the fact that such treatment should
have been considered by the Germans as the expression of justice,
that is truly characteristic of the plan of Germanization with its
repercussions on the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: It will be remembered that in 1914 this
library, which was certainly one of the best university libraries in
Europe, containing many early printed books, manuscripts and books
of the 16th and 17th centuries, was systematically destroyed by
means of incendiary material by the German soldiers of the 9th Reserve
Corps, commanded by General Von Ston. This time, in 1940,
the same thing happened again. This library was systematically
destroyed by the German Army; and in order that you may understand,
I must first say that the fire began, according to all the witnesses,
during the night from the 16th to the 17th of May 1940 at
about 1:30 in the morning. It was on the 17th at dawn that the
English Army made the necessary withdrawal maneuver to leave
the Q. W. line of defense. On the other hand, it is absolutely certain
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
that the first German troops entered on the morning of the 17th,
only about 8 o’clock. This interval between the departure of the
British troops, on the one hand, and the arrival of the Germans on
the other, enabled the latter to make it appear as if the library had
been systematically destroyed by the British troops. I must here
categorically give the lie to such a version. The library of the University
of Louvain was systematically destroyed by German gun fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two batteries were posted, one in the village of Corbek, and the
other in the village of Lovengule. These two batteries on each side
systematically directed their fire on the library and on nothing but
the library. The best proof of this is that all the shells fell on the
library; only one house near the library received a chance hit. The
tower was hit 11 times, 4 times by the battery which fired from
Lovengule, and 7 times by the battery which fired from Corbek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment when the Lovengule battery was about to begin
firing the officer who commanded it asked an inhabitant of the
village to accompany him into the field; when they arrived at a
place from where they could see the tower of the library, the officer
asked, “Is that the tower of the university Library?” The reply was
“Yes.” The officer insisted, “Are you sure?” “Yes,” replied the
peasant, “I see it every day, as you see it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later the shelling began, and immediately a column
of smoke arose quite near the tower. So there can be no doubt that
this bombardment was systematic and aimed only at the library.
On the other hand, it is also certain that a squadron of 43 airplanes
flew over the library and dropped bombs on the monument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Van der Essen, you are a member of the official
Belgian Commission for War Crimes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: In this capacity you investigated the events of which
you speak?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: The information which you have given the Tribunal,
then, is the result of an inquiry which you made and evidence by
witnesses which you heard yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: What I have just stated here is most certainly
the result of the official inquiry made by the Belgian War
Crimes Commission, assisted by several witnesses heard under oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Can you give information on the attempt at nazification
of Belgium by the Germans, and especially the attempt to
undermine the normal and constitutional organization of the public
authorities.
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Certainly. First, I think it is interesting to
point out that the Germans violated one of the fundamental principles
of the Belgian Constitution and institutions, which consisted
of the separation of powers, that is to say, separation of judicial
powers, of executive powers, and legislative powers; because in the
numerous organizations of the New Order, which they themselves
created either by decree or by suggesting the creation of these
organizations to their collaborators, they never made a distinction
between legislative and executive powers. Also, in these organizations
freedom of speech for the defense was never, or very little,
respected. But what is much more important is that they attacked
an organization which goes far back in our history, which dates back
to the Middle Ages; I mean the communal autonomy which safeguards
us and safeguards the people against any too dangerous
interference on the part of the central authority. This is what
happened in this domain: It would be sufficient to read, or to have
read for a short time, the present day Belgian newspapers, to observe
that the burgomasters, that is to say the chiefs of the communes,
the aldermen of the principal Belgian towns, such as Brussels,
Ghent, Liège, Charleroi, and also of many towns of secondary
importance—all these aldermen and burgomasters are either in
prison or about to appear before courts-martial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That shows sufficiently, I think, that these burgomasters and these
aldermen are not those who were appointed by the King and by
the Belgian Government before 1940, but all of them were people
who were imposed by the enemy by means of groups of collaborators,
VNV or “Rexists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is of capital importance to establish that fact, because the
burgomaster, as soon as he was directly responsible to the central
authority—in other words, as soon as the Leadership Principle was
applied—could interfere in all kinds of ways in the administrative,
political, and social life. The burgomaster appointed the aldermen;
the aldermen appointed the communal officials and employees, and
the moment the burgomaster belonged to that Party and was
appointed by that Party, he appointed as communal officials
members of the Party who could refuse ration cards to refractory
people, or order the police to give, for instance, the list of Communists,
or of those suspected of being Communists; in short, they
could interfere in almost any way they wished, and by every
possible means, in the communal life of Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we examine the big towns and the small towns, we can say
that everywhere there was truly a veritable network of espionage
and interference following the events or acts of which I have just
informed you.
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: It is true, then, to say that this meddling by the
Germans with the administration of the communes constituted a
seizure of Belgian national sovereignty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Certainly, since it made the fundamental
principle of the Belgian constitution disappear, that is to say, the
sovereignty that belongs to the nation and more especially to the
Communal Council which appointed aldermen and burgomasters.
From then on it was impossible for them to make themselves heard
in the normal way, so that the sovereignty of the Belgian people
was directly attacked by the fact itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Since you are a professor of higher education, can
you give us information concerning the interference in education?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, sir, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, there was interference in the domain of elementary and
secondary education through the General Secretary of Public
Education, on whom the Germans exercised pressure. A commission
was set up which was entrusted with the task of purging the text
books. It was forbidden to use text books which mentioned what
the Germans did in Belgium during the 1914-18 war; this chapter
was absolutely forbidden. The booksellers and publishing houses
could still sell these books, but only on the condition that the
bookseller or library should tear out this chapter. As for new
books which had to be reprinted or republished, this commission
indicated exactly which ones should be cancelled or removed. That
was serious and alarming interference with primary and secondary
education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards higher education, the interference was unleashed,
so to speak, from the very beginning of the occupation; and first
of all, for motives which I need not explain here but which are
well known, in the free University of Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans first imposed on the University of Brussels a
German Commissioner, who thus had in his hands the whole
organization of the university and even controlled it, as far as I
know, from the point of view of accountancy. Moreover they
imposed exchange professors. But serious difficulties began the
day when, in Brussels as elsewhere, they required that they should
be informed of all projects of new appointments and all new
appointments of professors, in the same way as the assignment of
lecture courses and other subjects taught in the university. The
result was that in Brussels, by virtue of this right which they had
arrogated, they wished to impose three professors, of whom two
were obviously not acceptable to any Belgian worthy of the name.
There was one, notably, who, having been a member of the Council
of Flanders during the occupation of 1914-18, had been condemned
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span>
to death by the justice of this country and whom they wanted to
impose as a professor in the University of Brussels in 1940. Under
these conditions the university refused to accept this professor, and
this was considered by the occupying authorities as sabotage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a penalty, the President of the Board of the University, the
principal members of the board, the deans of the principal faculties,
and a few other professors, who were especially well known as
being anti-Fascists, were arrested and imprisoned in the prison of
Witte with the aggravating circumstance that they were considered
as hostages and that, if any act whatsoever of sabotage or resistance
occurred, they, being hostages, could be shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the other universities were concerned, as I have just
said here, they wished to impose exchange professors. There were
none at Louvain because we refused categorically to receive them,
the more so as it appeared that these exchange professors were not,
primarily, scholars who had come to communicate the result of
their researches and their scientific work, but a great many of them
were observers for the occupying authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: In this connection, is it true that the Belgian
authorities discovered the report made by one of these so-called
“invited” professors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: That is indeed the case. The Belgian
authorities got hold of a report by Professor Von Mackensen, who
was sent as an exchange professor to the University of Ghent. In
this report—drawn up with infinite care and which is extraordinarily
interesting to read because of the personal and psychological
observations which it contains concerning the various members
of the faculty of Ghent—in this report we see that everyone was
observed and followed day by day, that his tendencies were labeled,
that a note was made as to whether he was for or against the
system of the occupying power, or whether he had any relations
with students who were N.P. or Rexists. The slightest movements
and actions of all the professors were carefully noted; and I add,
with great care and precision. It was almost a scientific piece .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Van der Essen, I described this morning to the
Tribunal various incidents which occurred in the University of
Louvain, of which you were the General Secretary. Therefore
I should like you to tell the Tribunal briefly the actual facts
connected with these incidents, especially, those connected with
the imprisonment of the Rector Monseigneur Van Wayenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, indeed, sir. Serious difficulties began
in the University of Louvain after the appearance of the decree of
compulsory labor of 6 March 1943, by which students of the
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span>
university were forced to accept compulsory labor. I would add,
not in Reich territory, but in Belgium. But this action, which was
held out to the university students as a sort of privilege, was
entirely inacceptable to Belgian patriots for the simple reason
that, if the university students accepted to go and work in the
Belgian factories, they automatically expelled workmen, who were
then sent to Germany as the students took their place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the first reason why they did not wish to work for the
enemy; the second was because, from a social point of view, they
wanted to show solidarity with the workers, who suffered very
much because the students had refused. At least two-thirds of the
students of Louvain refused to do compulsory work. They became
refractory, the classes became empty, they hid themselves as best
they could, and several went into the Maquis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German authorities, when they saw the way things were
going, demanded that the list of students be given to them, with
their addresses, so that they could arrest them in their homes or,
if they couldn’t find them, they could arrest a brother, or sister,
or father, or any member of the family in their place. This was
the principle of collective responsibility which was applied here
the same as in all other cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having used gentle means, they resorted to blackmail and
ended up by adopting really brutal measures. They renewed the
raids, they dismissed Dr. Tschacke and Dr. Kalische, I think, and many
others. They ordered searches to be made in the university offices
to lay their hands on the list of students; but as this list was carefully
hidden, they had to go away empty-handed. It was then that they
decided to arrest the Rector of the University, Monseigneur Van
Wayenberg, who had hidden the lists in a place known only to him.
He declared that he alone knew the place so as not to endanger his
colleagues and the members of the faculty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning in June two members of the Secret Police from
Brussels, accompanied by Military Police, came to the Hall. They
arrested the rector in his office and transferred him to the prison
of Saint-Gilles in Brussels, where he was imprisoned. Shortly
afterwards he appeared before a German tribunal which condemned
him to 18 months imprisonment for sabotage. To tell the truth, he
was in jail for only 6 months, because the doctor of Saint-Gilles
saw that the rector’s health was beginning to fail and it would be
dangerous to keep him longer if one wished to avoid a serious
incident, also because of the many petitions by all sorts of authorities.
Thus the rector was freed. However, he was forbidden to
set foot on the territory of Louvain; and they enjoined the university
to appoint, immediately, another rector. This was refused.
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Very well. Is it true to say that the German authorities
persecuted, more systematically, persons who belonged to the
intellectual elite?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, there can be no doubt as to this. I
might give, as examples, the following facts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>When hostages were taken it was nearly always university
professors, doctors, lawyers, men of letters, who were taken as
hostages and sent to escort military trains. At the time when the
resistance was carrying out acts of sabotage to railways and
blowing up trains, university professors from Ghent, Liège and
Brussels, whom I know, were taken and put in the first coach after
the locomotive so that, if an explosion took place, they could not
miss being killed. I know of a typical case, which will show you
that it was not exactly a pleasure trip. Two professors of Liège,
who were in a train of this kind, witnessed the following scene:
The locomotive passed over the explosive. The coach in which they
were, by an extraordinary chance, also went over it; and it was
the second coach containing the German guards which blew up, so
that all the German guards were killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, several professors and intellectuals were
deported to that sinister camp of Breendonck, about which you
know, some for acts of resistance, others for entirely unknown
reasons; others were deported to Germany. Professors from Louvain
were sent to Buchenwald, to Dora, to Neuengamme, to Gross-Rosen,
and perhaps to other places too. I must add that it was not only
professors from Louvain who were deported, but also intellectuals
who played an important role in the life of the country. I can give
you immediate proof. At Louvain, on the occasion of the reopening
ceremony of the university this year, as Secretary General of the
University, I read out the list of those who had died during the
war. This list included 348 names, if I remember rightly. Perhaps
some thirty of these names were those of soldiers who died
during the Battles of the Scheldt and the Lys in 1940, all the others
were victims of the Gestapo, or had died in camps in Germany,
especially in the camps of Gross-Rosen and Neuengamme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, it is certain that the Germans hated particularly the
intellectuals because, from time to time, they organized a synchronized
campaign in the press to give prominence to the fact that
the great majority of intellectuals refused categorically to rally to
the New Order and refused to understand the necessity for the
struggle against bolshevism. These articles always concluded by
stressing the necessity of taking measures against them. I
remember well certain newspaper articles which simply proposed
to send these intellectuals to concentration camps. There can be no
doubt therefore that the intellectuals were deliberately selected.
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I shall ask you no questions on anything relating to
deportations or to camps, because all that is already well known
to the Tribunal. I shall ask you, when replying to the following
question, not to mention deportation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, my question concerns the whole of the atrocities which
were committed by the Germans in Belgium and, especially, at the
time of the December 1944 offensive by the German armies. Can
you give information concerning these atrocities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, sir. As a matter of fact, I can give you
exact and detailed information, if necessary, on the crimes and
atrocities committed during the offensive of Von Rundstedt in the
Ardennes, because as a member of the War Crimes Commission
I went there to make an inquiry, and I questioned witnesses and
survivors of these massacres; and I know perfectly well, from
personal knowledge, what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the Von Rundstedt offensive in the Ardennes they
committed crimes which were truly abominable in 31 localities of
the Ardennes, crimes committed against men, women, and children.
These crimes were committed, on the one hand, as it happened
elsewhere and as it happens in all wars, by individual soldiers, so
I shall let that pass; but what I particularly want to stress are the
crimes committed by whole units who received formal instructions,
as well as crimes committed by known organizations; if I remember
rightly, I think they were called Kommandos zur besonderen Verwendung,
that is to say, commandos with special tasks which
operated unchecked not only in the Belgian Ardennes but which
also committed the same kind of crimes, carried out in the same
way, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the first, the crimes committed by whole units, I
should like merely to give one very typical example, in order not
to take up the time of the Tribunal. It happened at Stavelot,
where about 140 persons—the number varies, let us say between
137 and 140—first it was 137, then they discovered some more
bodies—about 140 persons, of whom 36 were women and 22 were
children, of which the oldest was 14 years and the youngest
4 years, were savagely slaughtered by German units belonging to
SS tank divisions, one the Hohenstaufen Division, the other the
SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler Division. This is what the divisions
did. We have full information about this from the testimony of a
soldier who took part in it. He was arrested by the Belgian
Security Police. He deserted during the Von Rundstedt campaign,
dressed himself as a civilian, and then worked as a laborer on an
Ardennes farm. One day as he was working stripped to the waist,
he was seen by Belgian gendarmes, who saw by the tattooing on
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span>
his body that he was an SS man. He was immediately arrested
and interrogated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the method used by the soldiers of the Hohenstaufen
Division. There was a line of tanks, some were Königstiger (Royal
Tigers), followed and preceded by Schützenpanzer. At a certain
moment the Obersturmführer of this group stopped his men and
delivered them a little speech telling them that all civilians whom
they encountered should be killed. They then went back to their
tanks, and as the tanks advanced along the road, the Obersturmführer
would point to a house. Then the soldiers entered it with
machine guns in their hands. If they found people in the kitchen,
they killed them in the kitchen; if they found them sheltering in
the cellar, they machine-gunned them in the cellar; if they found
them on the road, they killed them on the road. Not only the
Hohenstaufen Division, but also the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler
Division, and others acted in this manner on formal orders according
to which all civilians were to be killed. And what was the
reason for this measure? Precisely because, during the retreat in
September, it was mainly in that part of the Ardennes that the
resistance went into action and quite a number of German soldiers
were killed during that retreat. It was therefore to revenge this
defeat, to avenge themselves for the action of the resistance, that
orders were given that all civilians should be killed without mercy
during the offensive launched in this region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the other method is concerned, this is still more
important from the point of view of responsibility, for it concerns
persons commanding troops of the Sicherheitspolizei, that is to say,
of the Security Police, who in most villages they came to
immediately set about questioning the people as to those who had
taken part in the resistance, about the secret army, where these
people lived, whether they were still there or whether they had
fled. In short, they had special typed questionnaires with 27
questions, always the same, which were put to everyone in the
villages to which they came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here again I shall proceed as I did in the first case. In order
not to take up too much of the Tribunal’s time, I shall simply give
the example of Bande, in the Arrondissement of Marche. At Bande
one of these SD detachments, the officers of which said they were
sent especially by Himmler to execute members of the resistance,
seized all men between 17 and 32 years of age. After having
questioned them thoroughly and after sorting them out in a quite
arbitrary manner—they didn’t keep any people belonging to the
resistance, for most of them had never taken part in it; there were
only four who were members of the resistance—they led them
away along the road from Marche to Basteuil with their hands
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span>
raised behind their heads. When they reached a ruined house, which
had been burned down in September, the officer who commanded
the detachment posted himself at the entrance of the house, a
Feldwebel joined him and put his hand on the shoulder of the last
man of the third row who was making his way towards the entrance
to the house; and there the officer, armed with a machine gun,
killed a prisoner with a bullet in the neck. Then this same officer
executed in this manner the 34 young men who had been kept
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not content with killing them, he kicked the bodies into the
cellar; and then fired a volley of machine gun bullets to make sure
that they were dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Van der Essen, you are a historian; you have
taught scholars; therefore you are accustomed to submitting the
sources of history to criticism. Can you say that your inquiry
leaves no doubt in your mind, that these atrocities reveal that
there was an over-all plan and that instructions were certainly
given by superior officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I think that I can affirm it, I am quite
convinced that there was an over-all plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I would like to ask you a last question: I think I
understood that you yourself were never arrested or particularly
worried by the Germans. I would like to know if you consider
that a free man, against whom the German administration or police
have nothing in particular, could during the Nazi occupation lead
a life in accordance with the conception a free man has of his
dignity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Well, you see me here before you, I weigh
67 kilos, my height is 1 meter 67 centimeters. According to my
colleagues in the Faculty of Medicine that is quite normal. Before
the 10th of May 1940, before the airplanes of the Luftwaffe
suddenly came without any declaration of war and spread death
and desolation in Belgium, I weighed 82 kilos. This difference is
incontestably the result of the occupation. But I don’t want to
dwell on personal considerations or enter into details of a general
nature or of a theoretical or philosophical nature. I should like
simply to give you an account—it will not take more than
2 minutes—of the ordinary day of an average Belgian during the
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I take a day in the winter of 1943: At 6 o’clock in the morning
there is a ring at the door. One’s first thought—indeed we all had
this thought—was that it was the Gestapo. It wasn’t the Gestapo.
It was a city policeman who had come to tell me that there was
a light in my office and that in view of the necessities of the
<span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span>
occupation I must be careful about this in the future. But there
was the nervous shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 7:30 the postman arrives bringing me my letters; he tells the
maid that he wishes to see me personally. I go downstairs and the
man says to me, “You know, Professor, I am a member of the
secret army and I know what is going on. The Germans intend
to arrest today at 10 o’clock all the former soldiers of the Belgian
Army who are in this region. Your son must disappear immediately.”
I hurry upstairs and wake up my son. I make him prepare
his kit and send him to the right place. At 10 o’clock I take the
tram for Brussels. A few kilometers out of Louvain the tram stops.
A military police patrol makes us get down and lines us up—irrespective
of our social status or position—in front of a wall, with
our arms raised and facing the wall. We are thoroughly searched,
and having found neither arms nor compromising papers of any
kind, we are allowed to go back into the tram. A few kilometers
farther on the tram is stopped by a crowd which prevents the
tram from going on. I see several women weeping, there are cries
and wailings. I make inquiries and am told that their men folk
living in the village had refused to do compulsory labor and were
to have been arrested that night by the Security Police. Now
they are taking away the old father of 82 and a young girl of 16
and holding them responsible for the disappearance of the young
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I arrive in Brussels to attend a meeting of the academy. The
first thing the president says to me is:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Have you heard what has happened? Two of our colleagues
were arrested yesterday in the street. Their families were
in a terrible state. Nobody knows where they are.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I go home in the evening and we are stopped on the way
three times, once to search for terrorists, who are said to have
fled, the other times to see if our papers are in order. At last I
get home without anything serious having happened to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might say here that only at 9 o’clock in the evening can we
give a sigh of relief, when we turn the knob of our radio set and
listen to that reassuring voice which we hear every evening, the
voice of Fighting France: “Today is the 189th day of the struggle
of the French people for their liberation,” or the voice of Victor
Delabley, that noble figure of the Belgian radio in London, who
always finished up by saying, “Courage, we will get them yet, the
Boches!” That was the only thing that enabled us to breathe and
go to sleep at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was an average day, a normal day of an average Belgian
during the German occupation. And you can well understand that
we could hardly call that time the reign of happiness and felicity
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span>
that we were promised when the German troops invaded Belgium
on 10 May 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Excuse me, M. Van der Essen. The only satisfaction
that you had was to listen to the London radio; this was punished
by a severe penalty, if you were caught, I suppose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, it meant imprisonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you finished, M. Faure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: No more questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko? The American and British
prosecutors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Each indicated that he had no question.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel wish to
ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: You have been speaking about the university
library at Louvain. I should like to ask something: Were you
yourself in Louvain when the two batteries were firing at the
library, and at the library only, in 1940?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I was not in Louvain, but I should say this:
Louvain was in the K. O. line, that is in the very front line; and
the population of Louvain was obliged by the British military
authorities to evacuate the town on the 14th so that nearly all the
inhabitants of Louvain had left at the time when these events took
place and only paralytics and sick persons, who could not be transported
and who had hidden in their cellars, were left; but what I said
concerning these batteries, I know from the interrogation of the
two witnesses who were on the spot just outside Louvain. The
library was not set on fire from within, but shelled from without.
And these witnesses of whom I speak lived in these two villages
outside the town where the batteries were located.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Were there any Belgian or British troops still left
in the town?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: The Belgian troops were no longer there.
They had been replaced by the British troops when the British had
taken over the sector and at the time when the library was seen
to be on fire. The first flames were seen in the night of the 16th
to the 17th at 1:30 in the morning. The British troops had left.
There remained only a few tanks which were operating a withdrawal
movement. These fired an occasional shot to give the
impression that the sector was still occupied by the British Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: So there were still British troops in the town when
the bombardment started?
<span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: There were no longer any British troops;
there were merely a few tanks on the hills outside Louvain in the
direction of Brussels, a few tanks which, as I said, were carrying
out necessary maneuvers for withdrawal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would have liked to add a few words and to say to the very
honorable Counsel for the Defense that, according to the testimony
of persons who were in the library—the ushers and the janitors—not
a single British soldier ever set foot in the library buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: That is not surprising. At the time the German
batteries were firing were there still British batteries or Belgian
batteries firing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: So all was quiet in the town of Louvain; the troops
had left; the enemy was not there yet, and the batteries didn’t fire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: That was the rather paradoxical situation in
Louvain; there was a moment when the British had left and the
Germans had not yet arrived; and there remained only the few
ill persons, the few paralytics who could not be moved and who
were left behind in cellars. A few other persons remained too:
the Chief of the Fire Service and Monseigneur Van Wayenberg,
the Rector of the University, who had brought the dead and the
dying from Brussels to Louvain in the firemen’s car and made the
journey several times. There was also my colleague, Professor
Kennog, a member of the Faculty of Medicine who had taken over
the direction of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Do you know where these German batteries were
located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, indeed. One was located at Corbek and
the other at Lovengule, one on the west side and one on the north
side. The only shell hits on the tower of the library were four hits
from the east side and seven from the north side. If there had
still been British or Belgian batteries, the shells would have come
from the opposite side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Can you tell me anything about the caliber of these
batteries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, we saved the shells and at present they
are in the Library of Louvain, or rather in what serves as a
library for the university. There are four shells and two or three
fragments of shells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: And do you know the name of the peasant who
was supposed to have been asked by a German officer whether that
was really the University of Louvain? Do you know the peasant
personally?
<span class='pageno' title='547' id='Page_547'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, indeed, his name is M. Vigneron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Do you know the peasant yourself? Do you know
him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I do not know him personally. It was the
librarian of the university who had a conversation with him and
who induced the War Crimes Commission to interrogate this
peasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: You are a member of that commission yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, I am ready to declare that I took no
direct part in the inquiry concerning the Library of Louvain, just
as Monseigneur the Rector and the librarian took no active part
in the inquiry concerning the Library of Louvain. It was made by
an officer of the judicial delegation who acted alone and quite
independently upon the order of the Prosecutor of Louvain, and we
kept entirely out of the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Have you seen the official files of this commission?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: I am surprised they weren’t brought here. Tell me,
why did the director of the library or the person who was directly
concerned not go, after the occupation of the town, to the mayor or
to the commander of the town?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I don’t think I understand the question very
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: When the German Army came, a town commander
was appointed. Why didn’t the mayor of the town, or the Director
of the University Library go to the town commander and tell him
about these things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Why didn’t he tell him about these things—for
the very simple reason that at that time everything was in
complete disorder and there was hardly anybody left in the town,
and on the other hand as soon as the German Army arrived, it
systematically closed the entrance gate of the library so that the
Belgians could not make any inquiry. Then two German inquiry
commissions came upon the scene. The first worked on 26 May 1940
with an expert, Professor Kellermann of the School of Technology
in Aachen, accompanied by a Party man in a brown shirt. They
examined what was left and they summoned before them as witnesses
the Rector of the University and the Librarian. From the
very beginning of the inquiry they wished to force the rector and
the librarian to declare and admit that it was the British who had
set fire to the library. And as a proof, this expert showed shell cases
saying, “Here, sniff this, it smells of gasoline and shows that
chemicals were used to set fire to the library.” Whereupon the
<span class='pageno' title='548' id='Page_548'></span>
Rector and the Librarian of the University said to him, “Where did
you find this shell case, Mr. Expert?” “In such and such a place.”
“When we went by that place,” said the rector, “it wasn’t there.”
It had been placed there by the German expert. And I will add, if
you will permit me, because this is of considerable importance, that
a second inquiry commission came in August 1940, presided over by
a very distinguished man, District Court of Appeal Judge Von Neuss.
He was accompanied this time by the expert who had directed the
inquiry into the firing of the Reichstag. This commission again
examined everything, and before the rector and another witness,
Krebs, from the Benedictine Abbey of Mont-César, they simply
laughed at the conclusions of the first commission, and said they
were ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: You have said that the library building had towers.
Do you know whether there were artillery observers in these towers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: You ask whether there were artillery observers?
All I can say is that the rector had always opposed this from
the beginning, and he certainly would have opposed any attempt
of this kind, knowing that the presence of artillery observers in the
tower would obviously provide the enemy with a reason to fire on
the library. The rector knew this and he always said to me, “We
must be extremely careful to see that British soldiers or others who
might take the sector do not go up in the tower.” I know from the
statements of the janitor that no Englishman, no British soldier,
went into the tower. That is absolutely certain. As for Belgians,
I must confess that I cannot answer your question, as I don’t know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: It would not be so very amazing, would it, if the
university library had been hit by German artillery. After all, it
has happened that the libraries of the Universities of Berlin, Leipzig,
Munich, Breslau, Cologne, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, have been hit. The only
question is whether this was done deliberately, and here it occurs
to me that the peasant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: The peasant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: I would like to ask you: Was there any mention in
these inquiries as to the motive which might have induced the
German Army to make this an objective?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: All the evidence seems to indicate, and this
was the conclusion arrived at by the commission, that the motive—I
will not say the main motive, because there is no certainty in this
sort of thing—that the motive which is very probable, almost certain,
for the destruction of the library was the German Army’s
desire to do away with a monument which commemorates the Treaty
of Versailles. On the library building there was a virgin wearing a
helmet crushing under her foot a dragon which symbolized the
<span class='pageno' title='549' id='Page_549'></span>
enemy. Certain conversations of German officers gave the very
clear impression that the reason why they wished to set fire
systematically to this building was their desire to get rid of a
testimony of the defeat in the other war, and above all, a reminder
of the Treaty of Versailles. I may add that this is not the first time
that the Germans have destroyed the University of Louvain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: You believe that the commander of that battery
knew that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: There is very interesting testimony which I
should like to submit to the honorable Counsel for the Defense.
On the day when the batteries were installed, the two batteries
which I mentioned, I spoke to a tax collector, a civil servant, who
lived in a villa on the road to Roosweek, a few kilometers from
Louvain. That afternoon some German high-ranking officers came
to his house to ask for hospitality. These officers had with them a
truck with all the necessary radio apparatus for sending wireless
orders to the German artillery to fire. These officers installed themselves
in his house, and dinner was naturally served to them, and
they invited him to sit with them. After hesitating a moment, he
accepted, and during the meal there was a violent discussion. The
officers said, “These Belgian swine”—excuse my using this expression,
but they used it—“at any rate they did put that inscription on
the library.” They were referring to the famous inscription “<span class='it'>Furore
Teutonica</span>” which in fact was never on the library; but all the German
officers were absolutely convinced that this inscription “<span class='it'>Furore
teutonica diruta, dono americano restituta</span>” (destroyed by German
fury, restored by American generosity) was on the building, whereas,
in fact, it never has been there. However, I am quite willing to
admit that in Germany they might have believed that it was there;
and the very fact that there should have been a discussion among
the officers in command of these two batteries, seems to prove that
if they directed the fire onto the library, it was in order to destroy
this monument. It was probable that they wanted to get rid of a
monument which, according to their idea, bore an inscription which
was insulting to the German Army and the German people. That
is the testimony which I can give to the honorable Counsel for the
Defense. I give it as it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: You mean that the captain who commanded this
battery knew about that inscription! I don’t believe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, you have said that 43 airplanes flew
over the library and dropped bombs on it. As you told us yourself,
in reply to Professor Exner’s question, you were not in the town at
the time; where did you get that information?
<span class='pageno' title='550' id='Page_550'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: As I have already said, it is not my testimony
which I am giving here, because for my part I have none; but it is
the testimony of the lawyer, Davids, who had a country house at
Kesseloo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lawyer went out in the morning to look at the sky. He had
a considerable number of refugees in his home, among them women
and children, and as airplanes were continually overhead he had
gone out in the morning to see what was going on. He saw this
squadron of airplanes which he counted—remember he was an old
soldier himself—and there were 43 which were flying in the direction
of the library; and when they arrived over the library, exactly over
the gable at the farthest point from the house of the witness, they
dropped a bomb, and he saw smoke immediately arise from the
roof of the library. That is the testimony on which I base the
statement I just made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: So it was just one bomb that hit the library?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: We must distinguish here, sir, between
artillery fire and bombs which are dropped by planes. From a technical
point of view, it seems absolutely certain that a bomb from a
plane hit the library, because the roof has metal covering and this
metal roofing is quite level, except in one part where it caves in.
We consulted technicians, who told us that a metallic surface would
never have sunk in to such an extent if it had been hit by artillery
fire and could only have been caused by a bomb from a plane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many bombs in all were dropped by airplanes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: As the witness was at a height dominating
the Louvain area from where he could see the library on the plain,
it was impossible for him to count exactly the bombs which these
planes dropped. He only saw the bombs fall. Then he saw the
smoke which arose from the roof of the library. That’s all I have
to say concerning this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many bomb hits were counted in the city?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: On this point I can give you no information,
but I know that some airplanes passed over the library quarters in
a straight line going north to south. These bombs, at that time, in
May 1940, damaged, but not very seriously, the Higher Institute of
Philosophy, the Institute of Pharmacy, and a few other university
buildings; also a certain number of private houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When were the bombs dropped, before the artillery
fire or afterwards?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: The bombs were dropped before and afterwards.
There were some air raids. I myself was present during a
<span class='pageno' title='551' id='Page_551'></span>
terrible air-raid on the afternoon of 10 May 1940 by a squadron of
seven planes. I am not a military technician, but I saw with my
own eyes the planes which dive-bombed the Tirlemont Bridge. The
result of this bombing was that a considerable number of houses
were destroyed and 208 persons killed on the spot, on the afternoon
of 10 May 1940.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the other Defense Counsel wish to
cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Witness, when did you last see the university
building; that is, before the attack?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Before the fire? I saw it on 11 May 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: That is to say, before the attack?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Before the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Was it damaged at that time, and to what extent?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: On 11 May absolutely nothing had happened
to the library. It was intact. Until the night of the 16th to 17th of
May, when I left, there was absolutely no damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Apart from the hits on the tower, did you notice
any other traces of artillery fire on the building?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: On the building I don’t think so. There were
only traces of artillery fire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: From the fact that only the tower had been hit,
couldn’t it be thought that the tower and not the building was the
target?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: When I said that the tower was struck, I
meant only the traces that could be seen on the walls, on the balcony
of the first story, and on the dial of the clock. Apart from that,
nothing could be seen on the building for the simple reason that the
building had been completely burned out inside and nothing could
be seen on the charred walls. But it is absolutely certain that either
a bomb from a plane or an artillery shell—I personally think it was
the latter—hit the building on the north side, after the fire. The
trace of shell fire can be seen very visibly. It is just here that the
fire began. Witnesses who saw the fire of the Abbey of Mont César.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: After the fire, when did you see the building for
the first time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: After the fire, in July 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: That is, much later?
<span class='pageno' title='552' id='Page_552'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, but still in the same condition. Nothing
had been done to it. It was still as it was originally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Do you know whether, while the building was
burning, an attempt was made to stop the fire and save the building?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: It is absolutely certain that attempts were
made to stop the fire. The Rector of the University, Monseigneur
Van Wayenberg, told me himself and has stated that he sent for the
firemen, but the firemen had gone. Only the chief and two members
of the fire brigade were left, and all the water mains at that time
were broken as a result of the bombardment. There was no water
supply for several days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Did German troops take part in these attempts
to save the building?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: No, they were not there yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: How do you know that? You weren’t there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: But the Rector of the University did not
leave the town of Louvain. The rector was there and so was the
librarian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Did you speak to the rector on this question, as
to whether German troops took part in the attempt to save the
building?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I spoke to the rector and to the librarian. In
my capacity as General Secretary of the University I discussed with
the rector all general questions concerning the university. We
discussed this point especially, and he told me categorically that no
soldier of the German Army tried to fight the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: You also have spoken about the resistance movement.
Do you know whether the civilian population was called
upon to resist the German troops?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Where? In the Ardennes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: In Belgium?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: In Belgium the resistance was mainly composed
of the secret army, which was a military organization with
responsible and recognized commanders, and wore a distinctive
badge so that they could not be confused with simple <span class='it'>francs-tireurs</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Do you know how many German soldiers fell
victims to the resistance movement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: How German soldiers fell victims to this
resistance? I know very well because everywhere in the Ardennes
the resistance went into action, and legally, with chiefs at their
head, carrying arms openly, and with distinctive badges. They
openly attacked the German troops from the front.
<span class='pageno' title='553' id='Page_553'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: That was not my question. I asked you if you
knew roughly how many German soldiers became victims of that
resistance movement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I don’t understand what is implied by the
question of the honorable Counsel for the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: That is not for you to judge, it is for the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Does the honorable Counsel for the Defense
mean the events of the Ardennes which I alluded to a while ago, or
does he speak in a quite general sense?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The witness in his statements had himself
brought up the question of the resistance movement, and that is
why I asked whether the witness knows .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, the witness has already answered
the question by saying that he cannot say how many Germans were
killed by the resistance movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: But he can say whether a certain number of
Germans did fall victims to the resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: There were real battles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: The witness will also be able to confirm that the
members of the resistance are today considered heroes in Belgium.
From what we have read in the papers and from what has been
brought up here, these people who were active in the resistance
movement are now considered heroes. At least I could draw that
conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you please continue your examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Witness, you have said, if I understood you correctly,
that you lost 15 kilograms weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: What conclusion did you draw from that fact?
I could not quite understand what you said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VAN DER ESSEN: I simply meant to say that I lost these
15 kilos as a result of the mental suffering which we underwent
during the occupation, and it was an answer to a question of M.
Faure on whether I considered this occupation compatible with the
dignity of a free man. I wanted to answer “no,” giving the proof
that as a result of this occupation we suffered much anguish, and I
think the loss of weight is sufficient proof of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: During the war, I also, without having been ill,
lost 35 kilos. What conclusion could be drawn from that, in your
opinion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Laughter.</span>]
<span class='pageno' title='554' id='Page_554'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, Dr. Babel, we are not interested in
your experiences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Thank you, Sir. That was my last question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other Counsel wish to ask any
questions? [<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>] M. Faure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I have no questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness may retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I ask the Tribunal kindly to take the presentation
file and the document book constituting the end of the section on
the seizure of sovereignty, which bears the title “France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>France, like Belgium, was placed under the regime of the military
occupation administration. There was, moreover, in France a
diplomatic representation. Finally, it must be noted that the police
administration always played an important role there. It became
increasingly important and was extended, particularly during the
period which followed the appointment of General Oberg in 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards this last part of my section on the seizure of sovereignty,
I should like to limit myself to mentioning a few special
features of these usurpations in France and certain original methods
employed by the Germans in this country, for this question has
already been extensively dealt with, and will be further dealt with
by me under the heading of consequences of German activities in
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to draw the attention of the Tribunal to four considerations.
First, the German authorities in France, at the very beginning,
got hold of a special key to sovereignty. I speak of the
splitting up of the country into five different zones. This splitting
up of the country by the Germans compensated to a certain extent
for the special situation which the existence of unoccupied French
territories created for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already indicated that the Armistice Convention of
22 June, which has already been deposited with the Tribunal, provided
for the establishment of a line of demarcation between the
occupied zone and the so-called unoccupied zone. It might have
been thought at that time that this demarcation between the
occupied and the unoccupied zone was chiefly drawn to meet the
necessity of military movements in the occupied zone. It might also
have been concluded that the separation of the zones would be
manifested only through the exercise in the occupied zone of the
ordinary rights of an armed force occupation. I have already had
occasion to quote to the Tribunal a document, the testimony of
M. Léon Noël, which contained the verbal assurances given in this
<span class='pageno' title='555' id='Page_555'></span>
respect by General Keitel and by General Jodl, who are now the
defendants before you bearing these names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in fact, this demarcation of zones was interpreted and
applied with extreme rigor and in a manner that was wholly unforeseen.
We have already seen the far reaching consequences of
this from the point of view of the economic life of the country.
There were also serious consequences from the point of view of local
administration, which was continually hampered in its tasks, and
from the point of view of the life of the population, which could
move from one part of French territory to another only with great
difficulty. In this way the Germans acquired a first means of
pressure on the French authorities. This means of pressure was all
the more effective as it could be used at any time and was very
elastic. At times the Germans could relax the rules of separation
of the zones, at others they could apply them with the greatest
severity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of example, I quote an extract from a document, which
I present in evidence under the Document Number RF-1051.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is a letter of 20 December 1941 addressed by
Schleier of the German Embassy to the French Delegate De Brinon,
a letter concerning passes to German civilians wishing to enter the
unoccupied zone. The French authorities of the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government
had protested against the fact that the Germans obliged the French
authorities to allow any person provided with German passes to
enter the unoccupied zone where they could take on any kind of
work, particularly spying, as one may imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter which I quote is in answer to this French protest, and
I wish to mention only the last paragraph which is the second paragraph
on page 2 of this Document Number 1051.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“In case the French Government should create difficulties
concerning requests for passes presented with the German
approval, it will no longer be possible to exercise that same
generosity as shown hitherto when granting passes to French
nationals.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But what I have just said is only a first point concerning the
division of the country. This first division had as basis an instrument
which was the Armistice Convention, although this basis was
exceeded and was contestable. On the other hand, the other divisions
which I am going to mention were simply imposed by the Germans
without warning of any kind, and without the enunciation of any
plausible pretext.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must recall that a first supplementary division was that which
separated the annexed Departments of the Haut-Rhin, the Bas-Rhin,
and the Moselle from the rest of France; and in this connection I
have already proved that they had been really annexed.
<span class='pageno' title='556' id='Page_556'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A second division affected the Departments of Nord and the Pas-de-Calais.
These departments were in fact attached to the German
Military Administration of Belgium. This fact is shown by the
headings of the German Military Command decrees, which are submitted
to the Tribunal in the Belgian <span class='it'>Official Gazette</span>. Not only did
this separation exist from the point of view of the German Military
Command Administration, but it also existed from the point of view
of the French Administration. This last mentioned administration
was not excluded in the departments under consideration, but its
communications with the central services were extremely difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I do not wish to develop this point at length, I should like
simply to quote a document which will serve as an example, and
which I submit as Document Number RF-1052. This is a letter from
the military commander under the date of 17 September 1941, which
communicates his refusal to re-establish telegraphic and telephonic
communications with the rest of France. I quote the single sentence
of this letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Upon decision of the High Command of the Army it is so far
not yet possible to concede the application for granting direct
telegraphic service between the Vichy Government and the
two departments of the North.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A third division consisted in the creation within the unoccupied
zone of a so-called forbidden zone. The conception of this forbidden
zone certainly corresponded to the future projects of the Germans
as to the annexation of larger portions of France. In this connection
I produced documents at the beginning of my presentation. This
forbidden zone did not have any special rules of administration, but
special authorization was required to enter or to leave it. The return
to this zone of persons who had left it in order to seek refuge in
other regions was possible only in stages, and with great difficulty.
Administrative relations, the same as economic relations between
the forbidden zone and the other zones were constantly hampered.
This fact is well known. Nevertheless, I wish to quote a document
also as an example, and I submit this document, Number RF-1053.
It is a letter from the military commander, dated 22 November 1941,
addressed to the French Delegation. I shall simply summarize this
document by saying that the German Command agreed to allow a
minister of the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government to go into the occupied zone,
but refused to allow him to go into the forbidden zone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order that the Tribunal may realize the situation of these five
zones which I have just mentioned, I have attached to the document
book a map of France indicating these separations. This map of
France was numbered RF-1054, but I think it is not necessary for
me to produce it as a document properly speaking. It is intended to
enable the Tribunal to follow this extreme partitioning by looking,
<span class='pageno' title='557' id='Page_557'></span>
first at the annexed departments, and then at Nord and the Pas-de-Calais,
the boundaries of these departments being indicated on the
map, then at the forbidden unoccupied zone, which is indicated by
a first line; and, finally, the line of demarcation with the unoccupied
zone. This is, by the way, a reproduction of the map which was
published and sold in Paris during the occupation by Publishers
Girard and Barère.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To conclude this question of the division I should like to remind
the Tribunal that on 11 November 1942 the German Army forces
invaded the so-called unoccupied zone. The German authorities
declared at that time that they did not intend to establish a military
occupation of this zone, and that there would simply be what was
called a zone of operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German authorities did not respect this juridical conception
that they had thought out any more than they had respected the
rules of the law of the occupation; and the proof of this violation
of law in the so-called operational zone has already been brought in
a number of circumstances and will be brought again later in the
final parts of this presentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from this division, the inconveniences of which can well
be imagined for a country which is not very extensive and whose
life is highly centralized, I shall mention the second seizure of
sovereignty, which consisted in the control by the Germans of the
legislative acts of the French <span class='it'>de facto</span> government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, the German military administration, in conformity
with its doctrine, constantly exercised by its own decrees, a real
legislative power in regard to the French. On the other hand—and
it is this fact which I am dealing with now—in respect to the French
power the sovereignty of which the Germans pretended still to
recognize, they exercised a veritable legislative censorship. I shall
produce several documents by way of example and proof of this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first, which I submit as Document Number RF-1055, is a
letter from the Commander-in-Chief of the Military Forces in France
to the French Delegate General; the letter is dated 29 December 1941.
We see that the signature on this letter is that of Dr. Best, of whom
I spoke this morning in connection with Denmark, where he went
subsequently and where he was given both diplomatic and police
functions. I think it is not necessary for me to read the text of this
letter. I shall read simply the heading: “Subject: Bill Concerning
the French Budget of 1942, and the New French Finance Law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German authorities considered that they had the power to
take part in the drawing up of the French <span class='it'>de facto</span> government’s
budget, although this bore no relation to the necessities of their
military occupation. Not only did the Germans check the contents
of the laws prepared by the <span class='it'>de facto</span> government, but they made
<span class='pageno' title='558' id='Page_558'></span>
peremptory suggestions. I shall not quote any document on this
point at the moment, as I shall be producing two: One in connection
with propaganda and the other in connection with the regime
imposed upon the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third seizure of sovereignty which the Germans exercised
consisted in their intervention in the appointment and assignment
of officials. According to the method which I have already followed,
I submit, on this question, documents by way of example. First I
submit a document which will be Document Number RF-1056, a
letter of 23 September 1941, from the Commander-in-Chief Von
Stülpnagel to De Brinon. This letter puts forth various considerations,
which it is not necessary to read, on the sabotage of harvests
and the difficulties of food supplies. I read the last paragraph of
Document RF-1056.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I must, therefore, peremptorily demand a speedy and unified
direction of the measures necessary for assuring the food
supplies for the population. A possibility of achieving this
aim I can see only by uniting both ministries in the hands of
one single and energetic expert.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was, therefore, a case of interference on the very plane of the
composition of a ministry, of an authority supposedly governmental.
As regards the control of appointments, I produce Document Number
RF-1057, which is a letter from the Military Command of 29 November
1941. I shall simply summarize this document by indicating
that the German authorities objected to the appointment of the
President of the Liaison Committee for the Manufacture of Beet
Sugar. You see, therefore, how little this has to do with military
necessities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I next produce Document Number RF-1058, which is likewise a
letter from the Military Command. It is brief and I shall read it
by way of example:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“I beg you to take the necessary measures in order that the
Subprefect of St. Quentin, M. Planacassagne, be relieved of
his functions and replaced as soon as possible by a competent
official. M. Planacassagne is not capable of carrying out his
duties.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now quote a text of a more general scope. I produce
Document Number RF-1059, which is a secret circular of 10 May
1942, addressed by the Military Command Administrative Staff to
all the chief town majors. Here again we find the signature of
Dr. Best.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Control of French policy as regards personnel in the occupied
territories.
<span class='pageno' title='559' id='Page_559'></span></p>
<hr class='tbk543'/>
<p class='noindent'>“The remodelling of the French Government presents certain
possibilities for exercising a positive influence on French
police in the occupied territories as regards personnel. I,
therefore, ask you to designate those French officials, who,
from the German point of view, appear particularly usable
and whose names could be submitted to the French Government
when the question of appointing holders for important
posts arises.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus we see in the process of formation this general network of
German control and German usurpation. I now produce Document
Number RF-1060. This document is an interrogation of Otto Abetz,
who had the function of German ambassador in France. This interrogation
took place on 17 November 1945 before the Commissioners
Berge and Saulas at the General Information Bureau in Paris. This
document confirms German interferences in French administration
and likewise gives details about the duplications of these controls
by the military commander and the Gestapo. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Military Commander in France, basing himself on the
various conventions of international law”—this is Otto Abetz
who is speaking and it is not necessary to say that we in
no way accept his conception of international law—“considered
himself responsible and supreme judge for the
maintenance of order and public security in the occupied
zone. This being so, he claimed the right to give his approval
for the appointment or the retaining of all French officials
nominated to occupy posts in the occupied zone. As regards
officials residing in the free zone who were obliged by reason
of their functions to exercise them subsequently in the
occupied zone, the Military Commander also stressed the
necessity for his approval of their nomination. In practice
the Military Commander made use of the right thus claimed
only when the officials were nominated and solely in the
sense of a right to veto, that is to say, he did not intervene
in the choice of officials to be nominated and contented
himself with making observations on certain names proposed.
These observations were based on information which the
Military Commander received from his regional and local
commanders, from his various administrative and economic
departments in Paris, and from the police and the Gestapo,
which at that time were still under the authority of the
Military Commander.</p>
<hr class='tbk544'/>
<p class='noindent'>“From 11 November 1942 on, this state of things changed
because of the occupation of the free zone. The German
military authorities settled in this zone demanded that they
should give their opinion in regard to the nomination of
<span class='pageno' title='560' id='Page_560'></span>
officials in all cases where the security of the German Army
might be affected. The Gestapo for its part acquired in the
two zones a <span class='it'>de facto</span> independence with regard to the regional
and local military chiefs and with regard to the Military
Commander. It claimed the right to intervene in connection
with any appointment which might affect the carrying out
of their police tasks.</p>
<hr class='tbk545'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Having been recalled to Germany from November 1942 to
December 1943, I did not myself witness the conflicts which
resulted from this state of things and which could not fail
to compromise in the highest degree the so-called sovereignty
of the Vichy Government. When I returned to France the
situation was considerably worse because the Gestapo claimed,
in the occupied as well as in the unoccupied zone, the right
to make the nomination of prefects subject to its consent. It
even went so far as to propose itself the officials to be
nominated by the French Government. Seconded by me, the
Military Commander took up again the struggle against these
abusive demands and succeeded in part in restoring the
situation to what it was before November 1942 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The document which I have just read constitutes a transition
to the fourth consideration which I should like to submit to the
Tribunal. In putting this consideration I should like to stress
the juxtaposition and the collaboration of the various agents of
usurpation, that is to say, the military command, the embassy, and
the police. As regards the latter I shall deal at greater length with
its role in the last part of my brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the setting up of the German Embassy in France,
I produce before the Tribunal Exhibit Number RF-1061. This
document was in my file as a judicial translation of a judicial
document in the file concerning Otto Abetz in Paris. On the other
hand, it is also contained in the American documentation and bears
the Document Number 3614-PS. It has not, however, as yet been
submitted to the Tribunal. It deals with the official appointment
of Otto Abetz as ambassador. I should like to read this Document
RF-1061.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 3 August 1940.</p>

<hr class='tbk547'/>
<p class='noindent'>“I. Ambassador Abetz has the following functions in France:</p>

necessary orders to the military agencies concerned as
quickly as possible.</p>
<hr class='tbk557'/>
<p class='noindent'>“Signed: Ribbentrop.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document shows the close collaboration that existed between
the military administration and the administration of foreign
affairs, a collaboration which, as I have already said on several
occasions, is one of the determining elements for establishing
responsibility in this Trial, a collaboration of which I shall later on
give examples of a criminal character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now wish to mention to the Tribunal that I eliminate the production
of the next document which was numbered RF-1062. Although
I am personally certain of the value of this document which comes
from a French judicial file, I have not the original German text.
This being so, the translation might create difficulties, and it is
naturally essential that each document produced should present
incontestable guarantees. I shall therefore pass directly to the last
document, which I wish to put in and which I submit as Document
<span class='pageno' title='562' id='Page_562'></span>
Number RF-1063. This is a detail, if I may call it such, concerning
this problem of the collaboration of the German administrations,
but sometimes formal documents concerning details may present
some interest. It is a note taken from the German archives in
Paris, a note dated 5 November 1943, which gives the distribution
of the numbering of the files in the German Embassy. I shall read
simply the first three lines of this note: “In accordance with the
method adopted by the military administration in France, the files
are divided into 10 chief groups.” There follows the enumeration
of these methods and groups used for the classification of the files.
I wish simply to point out that under their system of close collaboration
the German Embassy, a civil service department of the
foreign office, and the Military Command had adopted filing
systems under which all records and all files could be kept in the
same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have now concluded my second section which was devoted to
the general examination of this seizure of sovereignty in the
occupied territories, and I should like to point out that these files
have been established with the collaboration of my assistant, M.
Monneray, a collaboration which also included the whole brief
which I present to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now ask the Tribunal to take the files relative to Section 3,
devoted to the ideological Germanization, and to propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had occasion to speak to the Tribunal about forced
labor and economic pillage I said that the Germans had taken all
available manpower, goods, and raw materials from the occupied
countries. They drained these countries of their reserves. The
Germans acted in exactly the same manner with regard to the
intellectual and moral resources. They wished to seize and eliminate
the spiritual reserves. This expression “spiritual reserves,” which
is extremely significant, was not invented by the Prosecution. I
have borrowed it from the Germans themselves. I have quoted
to the Tribunal another extract from a work which was submitted
as a document under Number RF-5 of the French documentation.
This was a book published in Berlin by the Nazi Party. The author
was Dr. Friedrich Didier. This work has a preface by the Defendant
Sauckel and is entitled <span class='it'>Working For Europe</span>. The quotation which
I should like to make appears in the document book under 1100,
which is simply the order of sequence, as the book itself has
already been presented and submitted. The book includes a chapter
entitled “Ideological Guidance and Social Assistance.” The author
is concerned with the ideological guidance of the foreign workers
who were taken away by millions to the Reich by force. This
preoccupation with the ideological guidance of such an important
element of the population of the occupied countries is already
<span class='pageno' title='563' id='Page_563'></span>
remarkable in itself; but it is, on the other hand, quite evident that
this preoccupation is general with regard to all the inhabitants of
the occupied countries, and the author in this case has simply
confined himself to his subject. I have chosen this quotation to begin
my section because its wording seemed to me to be particularly
felicitous to enable us to get an idea of the German plans in regard
to propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 69 of the book that has been put in evidence reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The problem of ideological guidance of the foreign worker
is not as simple as in the case of the German fellow worker.
In employing foreigners far more importance must be paid
to the removal of psychological reservations. The foreigner
must get accustomed to unfamiliar surroundings. His
ideological scruples must be dispersed, if he has any. The
mental attitude of the nationals of former enemy states must
be just as effectively refuted as the consequences of foreign
ideologies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the occupied countries the Germans undertook to eliminate
the mental reserves and to expurgate the ideology of each man in
order to substitute for them the Nazi conception. Such was the object
of the propaganda. This propaganda had already been introduced
in Germany and it was carried on there unceasingly. We have
seen from the article just quoted that there was also a preoccupation
with the ideological guidance of the German worker, although
the problem was considered there to be more simple. When we
speak today of Nazi propaganda we are often tempted to underestimate
the importance of this propaganda. There are grounds
for underestimating it, but they are false grounds. On the one
hand, when we consider the works and the themes of propaganda,
we are often struck by their crudeness, their obviously mendacious
character, their intellectual or artistic poverty. But we must not
forget that the Nazi propaganda utilized all means, the most crude
as well as the more subtle and often skillful methods. From
another point of view the crudest affirmations are those that
carry most weight with some simple minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, we must not forget that if the Germans had won the
war, these writings, these films, which we find ridiculous, would
have constituted in the future our principal and soon our sole
spiritual food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another remark that is often heard is that German propaganda
achieved only very poor results. Indeed, these results are quite insignificant,
especially if one takes into account the means which this
propaganda had at its disposal. The enslaved peoples did not listen
to the news and to the exhortations of the Germans. They threw
themselves into the resistance. But here again we must consider
<span class='pageno' title='564' id='Page_564'></span>
that the war continued, that the broadcasts from the countries
which had remained free gave out magnificent counter propaganda,
and that finally the Germans after a time suffered military
reverses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If events had been different perhaps this propaganda would, in
the long run, have brought about an acquiescence on the part of
the more important elements of the populations which would have
been worse than the oppression itself. It is fortunate that only
a very small minority in the different countries were corrupted
by the Nazi propaganda, but however small this minority may
have been, it is for us a cause for sadness and of just complaint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slogans of Nazi propaganda appear to us less childish and
less ridiculous when we consider the few wretches who, influenced
by it, enrolled in a legion or in the Waffen SS to fight against
their countries and against humanity. By their death in this
dishonorable combat or after their condemnation some of these men
have expiated their crimes. But Nazi propaganda is responsible for
the death of each one of them and for each one of these crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, we are not sure that we know today exactly the real
effect of Nazi propaganda. We are not sure that we are able to
measure all the harm which it has done to us. The nations count
their visible wounds, but propaganda is a poison which dissolves
in the mental organism and leaves traces that cannot be discerned.
There are still men in the world who, because of the propaganda
to which they have been subjected, believe, perhaps obscurely,
that they have the right to despise or to eliminate another man
because he is a Jew or because he is a Communist. The men who
believe this still remain accomplices and, at the same time, are
victims of Nazism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of my colleagues has shown that while the physical health
of the occupied peoples was severely undermined, their moral
health appears more robust; but it must still be anxiously watched
for a certain time in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For these reasons, the French Prosecution has considered that
there was room in this accusation for the section on spiritual
Germanization and propaganda. This propaganda is a criminal
enterprise in itself. It is an onslaught against the spiritual condition,
according to the definition of M. de Menthon, but it is also a means
and an aggravating circumstance of the whole of the criminal
methods of the Nazis, since it prepared their success and since it
was to maintain their success. It was considered by the Germans
themselves, as numerous quotations show, as one of the most
reliable weapons of total war. It is more particularly a means and
an aspect of the Germanization which we are studying at this
moment. I should add that German propaganda has been constantly
<span class='pageno' title='565' id='Page_565'></span>
developed for many years and over considerable areas. It assumed
very diverse forms. We have therefore only to define some of its
principal features and to quote merely a few characteristic documents,
chiefly from the point of view of the responsibility of certain
persons or of certain organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over a long period of time the Reich had developed official
propaganda services in a ministerial department created as early
as 1933 under the name of Ministry of Public Enlightenment and
Propaganda, with Goebbels at the head and the Defendant Fritzsche
performing important functions. But this ministry and its department
were not the only ones responsible for questions of propaganda.
We shall show that the responsibility of the Minister and of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is equally involved. We shall
likewise show that the Party took an active part in propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, I mention here that in the occupied countries the
military commands constituted organs of propaganda and were
very active. This fact must be added to all those which show that
the German military command exercised powers wholly different
from what are normally considered to be military powers. By this
abnormal extension of their activities, apart from the crimes
committed within the framework of their direct competence, the
military chiefs and the High Command have furnished justification
for the allegation of joint responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German propaganda always presents two complementary
aspects, a negative aspect and a positive aspect: A negative or, in
a sense, a destructive aspect, that of forbidding or of limiting
certain liberties, certain intellectual possibilities which existed
before; a positive aspect, that of creating documents or instruments
of propaganda, of spreading this propaganda, of imposing it on the
eyes, on the ears, and on the mind. An authority has already said
that there are two different voices: The voice that refuses truth
and the voice that tells lies. This duality of restrictive propaganda
and of constructive propaganda exists in the different realms of
the expression of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall mention now, in my first paragraph, the measures taken
by the Germans as regards meetings and associations. The German
authorities have always taken measures to suppress the right of
assembly and association in the occupied countries. We are here
concerned both with the question of political rights and of thought.
In France, a decree of 21 August 1940, which appeared in the
<span class='it'>Official Gazette</span> of German Decrees of 16 September 1940, forbade
any meeting or association without the authorization of the German
military administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must not be thought that the Germans utilized their powers
in this matter only in regard to associations and groups which were
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span>
hostile to them, or even those whose object was political. They
were anxious to avoid any spreading of an intellectual or moral
influence which would not be directly subordinated to them. In
this connection I present to the Tribunal, merely by way of example,
Document Number RF-1101, which is a letter from the Military
Commander dated 13 December 1941, addressed to the General
Delegate of the French Government. This deals with the youth
groups. Even with regard to associations or groups which should
have a general public character, the German authorities gave their
authorization only on condition that they would be able to exercise
not only their control over these organizations, but a real influence
by means of these organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall read the first paragraph of this Document Number
RF-1101.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“The General Secretariat of Youth has informed us by letter
of 11 November 1941 of its intention to establish so-called
social youth centers whose aim shall be to give to youth a
civic education and to safeguard it from the moral
degeneracy which threatens it. The creation of these social
youth centers, as well the establishment of youth camps,
must be sanctioned by the Commander-in-Chief of the
Military Forces in France. Before being able to make a final
decision as to the creation of these social centers, it appears
indispensable that greater details should be furnished, particularly
about the persons responsible for these centers in
the various communes, the points of view which will prevail
when selecting the leaders of these centers, the principal
categories of youth to be recruited and detailed plans for the
intended instruction and education of these young people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now produce Document Number RF-1102. This document
is a note, dealing with .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing</span>] M. Faure, could you tell us how
long you think you will be on this subject of propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: I expect to speak for about two hours, or two and
a half hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the program after you have done
with this subject of propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, as I indicated at the beginning of
my presentation, it includes four sections. The propaganda section,
about which I am speaking now, constitutes Section 3. The fourth
section is devoted to the administrative organization of the criminal
action. It corresponds, more exactly, to the second heading under
Count Four of the Indictment relative to the persecution of the
Jews in the occupied countries of the West. After this section
I shall have completed my presentation. Does the Tribunal likewise Pg571
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span>
wish me to indicate what will follow in the program of the French
Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we would like to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: M. Mounier will deal with the analytical brief and
the recapitulation of the individual accusations of the Prosecution.
Then I think M. Gerthoffer is to speak rather briefly about the
pillage of art treasures which has not been dealt with; it appears
now that it would be suitable to deal with it within the framework
of the presentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then we will adjourn now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. FAURE: Mr. President, I should like to ask the Tribunal if
it is convenient for it to see tomorrow, in the course of my
propaganda section, a few projections on the screen of documents
which relate to this chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think so. Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Regarding the questions which I asked the
witness, there is something I did not understand. I did not want,
in any case, to speak about the resistance or about its methods
which were animated by patriotism. I did not want to judge, or
even think anything derogatory about it. I wanted only to prove
that deeds which are said to have been committed by the German
troops were in many cases caused by the attitude of the civilian
population and that actions against Germans which were contrary
to international law have not been judged in the same way as
lapses laid to the charge of members of the German Wehrmacht.
I am of the opinion that the Indictment of the organizations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Babel, will you forgive me for a
moment. You concluded your cross-examination some time ago,
and the Tribunal doesn’t desire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: Yes, Mr. President, but I thought that by this
statement I could clarify it for the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We don’t need any clarification at all. We
quite understand the point of your cross-examination and we shall
hear you when the time comes, very fully in all probability, in
support of the arguments which you desire to present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BABEL: I did so because I thought that you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You must give the Tribunal credit for
understanding your cross-examination. We really cannot continue
to have interruptions of this sort. We have some twenty defendants
and some twenty counsels, and if they are all going to get up in
the way that you do and make protests, we shall never get to the
end of this Trial.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
